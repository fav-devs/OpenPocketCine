# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Desktop: the viewfinder chrome is a DJI Mimo replica for a landscape laptop
  (Outfit type, Tabler icons, every button with its key hint), with format,
  exposure and settings sheets, and a media library — the card listed through
  the core's decoder with the Pocket 3's `0x01/0x01` playback entry, thumbnails
  and files over `/v2`, star and delete, and the 720p proxy played through the
  feed pipeline so the assists work on it. The Camera tab gains the gimbal
  ramp, the Assist tab a LUT row fed by the official cubes and a `.cube`
  drop folder, and the countdown length. `K` opens programmed moves: A, B
  and C from the live pose, per-leg durations, exact legs on native timed
  targets with the approach, hold and missing-sector guard. `A` shows the
  phones' assist toolbar: false colour (the core's CineStop / EL Zone / IRE /
  Limits lattices, now built in `OpenPocketViewCore` for every shell, with a
  reference key), peaking sensitivity and colour, zebra levels and colours on
  the feed's axis, thirds / phi / diagonal grid, guide frames with a mask, and
  the crosshair. Live-control SETs run through the core's `CameraSetMailbox`
  (latest wins, 300 ms retransmit, 2 s settle, FORMAT pin, "no answer" notice)
  and the zoom ruler carries the body's own stops with the D-Log2 hop. A
  click on the picture is Mimo's tap-to-focus burst, a drag is a tracking
  box polled until the body locks or lets go, and the Camera tab has the
  focus-track mode. Wind noise reduction and directional audio read the
  body's DSP blob and send it back patched. The scopes — waveform, parade,
  histogram, vectorscope, traffic lights, the ND chip and the audio meters —
  are movable plates sampled from the picture on the CPU and plotted on the
  core's axis. Settings gains the Link, Controls, Display, Storage and System
  tabs: reconnect, joystick sensitivity through the core's stick curve, a game
  controller on the phones' map, DISP and per-part chrome toggles, the cache
  size and a clear, a diagnostics report; the operator's settings persist
  beside the LUT folder. Programmed moves gain the phones' smoothness (a
  Bézier fillet at B, streamed as look-ahead targets) and pause / resume from
  the stopped pose. The library gains the phones' select mode with a batch
  delete and folds bursts under their first frame; the player gains the
  conform chip (the core's `ConformPreview` targets and speed) and Auto LUT
  from the original's `moov` tail through `ClipColorProfile` and
  `OfficialDJILUT.auto`. The System tab gains a virtual camera: the graded
  picture, clean or as shown, into the platform's own camera — a
  `v4l2loopback` device on Linux, a Media Foundation virtual camera on
  Windows 11 (`opc-vcam-win`, a COM source the Frame Server loads, fed
  over a named pipe), the OpenPocketCine camera extension on macOS
  (`Apps/Desktop/macos`, written through the facade's sink-stream writer)
  — or a loopback MJPEG stream OBS's Virtual Camera carries anywhere
  (`opc-vcam`). Settings gains an Output tab that checks for the platform
  component, installs or removes it the platform's own way, and hosts the
  camera controls. Unqualified on a physical body.

- Experimental AirPods head tracking now maps shared-forward head direction to
  native gimbal angles with a 100 ms command horizon. Stale measurements,
  inactive scenes and old control callbacks cannot continue driving. Manual
  and programmed movement take priority; physical response qualification is ongoing.

### Added

- Apple Watch companion (#101): live preview, timecode, storage, camera
  battery, and record / shutter on the wrist. The iPhone stays the radio.
  A watch rec tap starts and stops without the phone confirmation sheet.
  Wear OS and a complication are follow-ons.

- Convert log on iOS Share
  ([discussion #295](https://github.com/erik-sutton95/OpenPocketCine/discussions/295)):
  technical D-Log ↔ D-Log2 rewrite so mixed 1× / zoom takes share one
  curve. Off by default. Exclusive with Bake LUT. Rec.709 display stays
  Bake LUT. Camera original untouched. D-Log M is out. Android share
  still the original (`docs/PARITY.md`).

- False color **EL Zone** scale: 15 contiguous scene-EV bands around 18%
  gray. +6 and above white, −6 and below black. Extra D-Log2 headroom
  stays white, not a separate clip stripe. iOS and Android.

- False color **IRE** is six video-level WAVE zones over grayscale
  (crush / near-black / 18% gray / +1 stop / 80 / 95 clip). **CineStop**
  (formerly PStops) is Video Mode IRE stripes over grayscale. Saved
  PStops still load as CineStop.

- ND view assist (discussion #196): toolbar **ND** (next to LIGHTS)
  meters the live picture against middle gray and suggests a screw-on
  ND to balance the frame. Small HUD chip, parked bottom-left above the
  assist bar; hold-drag to move. Long-press **Units** switches Stops
  (`+5.0`), filter factor (`ND32`), and optical density (`ND 0.3` /
  `ND 0.4`). Off unless you turn the chip on. The app cannot set a
  filter. iOS and Android.

- Gimbal controls button beside the zoom chip (#47, #79, #48, #211).
  One sheet: Follow / Tilt locked / FPV / Locked, Slow / Default / Fast,
  stick ramp Off / Soft / Medium, and Motion Control. The sheet parks
  like a capture picker (slide-up glass above the capture bar). Locked
  toasts — no lock-all opcode on the wire yet (#174). Ramp is local
  ease-in/out on the stick path (#260), not camera speed. Motion Control
  uses camera-timed A→B (optional C) trajectories with waypoint verification.
  It preserves durations from 0.5 to 120 seconds without rate calibration or
  an artificial speed ceiling. C enables adjustable Bézier smoothing and a
  dashed preview; markers compensate for measured motion between reports.
  Start counts down three seconds. Pause holds the remaining path; Resume
  continues from the stopped pose. Stop discards the continuation. The wider
  editor has swipeable duration dials (left increases, right decreases),
  refresh icons and C hidden until B is set. Hold anywhere to move the editor;
  dragging the minimized pill suppresses button taps. Debug chrome is removed.
  Preparation selects Fast and tilt unlocked. No zoom SET during movement.
  Manual control, disconnect and ActiveTrack cancel the path. Native targets
  respect the reachable pan arc and tilt limits, including selfie orientation.
  Nano hides the button. Both shells; physical precision remains experimental.

- Experimental iOS Multiview for Osmo cameras on shared Wi-Fi: identity-verified
  discovery, saved stages, adaptive grid/Center stage, per-camera LUTs and
  timecode, individual/group recording, tally borders and borrowed Live View.
  Pocket 4 Pro, Pocket 3 and Nano have been monitored and recorded together.
  Android Multiview is deferred; setup cleanup and hardware validation remain
  open before release. See the Multiview handbook and `docs/PARITY.md`.

- Local VPN / ad-blocker warning (#239): Join camera Wi-Fi tells the
  operator to pause VPNs and ad blockers or exclude this app. If the well
  stays on WAITING FOR LIVE VIEW for 8 s with a local VPN on, the same
  hint appears on the well. Diagnostics reports include `vpn=on|off`.
  Handbook troubleshooting names AdGuard, Blokada, and RethinkDNS. Not a
  bind-ladder fix — official camera apps fail the same way.

- On-device diagnostics: redacted journal, exceptions, MetricKit payloads
  (iOS), and **Share Diagnostics** on Connection setup (first pair) and
  Operator Setup → System. A TestFlight screenshot copies a compact paste
  (Apple cannot attach files to that form). No name, location, or Wi-Fi
  password. No upload. `docs/diagnostics.md`.

- Live head-tracking debug: yaw ring (12 o'clock is SET) and a vertical
  pitch ring (arrow-right is 0). iOS only. White arrow is the SET-relative
  nose (AirPods +Y forward, +Z up); sky arrow is live gimbal pan/tilt.
  A nod does not drag yaw; an ear-to-shoulder roll does not drive the yaw
  ring.

- Head tracking (iOS, experimental): Operator Setup → Controls
  **Head Tracking (Experimental)**, off by default. **Calibrate Head
  Lock** is shared identity: that AirPods pose and that gimbal pose are
  zero. Δatt yaw/pitch from SET are pan/tilt in degrees (physical take:
  a 90° head turn is attitude yaw, not quaternion look-right; yaw is
  inverted onto stick right). Stick
  throw closes live `0x04/0x05` onto that pose. Roll is shown only —
  `0x04/0x01` has no roll axis. STOP clears SET. On-screen stick and a
  game controller win while held. Android has no AirPods IMU.

- Game controller (discussion #159): left stick pans and tilts with the
  same expo throw as the on-screen stick. Cross/A records (skips the
  rec-confirmation sheet). Circle/B recenters. Square/X is rotate-180.
  Triangle/Y tracks a face in frame or cancels. L1/R1 jump the zoom chip
  (out does not wrap to tele). L2/R2 hold-to-zoom (deeper trigger is
  faster). D-pad up/down ISO, left/right shutter. Toast Gamepad
  connected/disconnected; unplug rests the stick. Controls **Gamepad**
  row shows Connected / Not connected. Joystick Sensitivity 1–5 is the
  same gain as the on-screen stick. A mechanical stop pulses the phone
  and rumbles the pad only after that axis moves then stalls (Haptics
  setting). iOS and Android.

- Play closed-testing pipeline (GitHub Actions signed AAB → `alpha` track)
  and tester notes under `Apps/Android/Play/`. Wizard:
  `just android-play-setup`. Contract: `docs/android-play-ci.md`.

- Play CI matches OpenZCine: fail-closed `play-closed` secrets, signed AAB
  artifact, auto-upload on `main` once `ANDROID_PLAY_UPLOAD=true`. Dispatch
  can attach the first Console AAB before the Play API robot exists.

- Live feed **observe** line (`feed: observe diagnose=… watchdog=… disagree=…`)
  so a physical take can classify freeze-in-seconds (#148) against
  `LinkDiagnoser` without changing repair. Contract:
  `docs/connection-reliability.md`.

- Live recover no longer re-enables on every recording-format VPS hop, no
  longer rebuilds UDP 2 s after an encoder pause while status is still
  arriving, and re-arms pktType `0x02` ingest on the enable write (including
  after a UDP rebuild). First picture waits the GOP-reset grace before a
  second enable or UDP rebuild, and does not GOP-cut a live picture with
  `still holding for IDR`.

- LUT exposure compensation in the LUT popup (live and playback, iOS and
  Android): plus/minus in half-stops from −3 to +3, applied as input-referred
  gain before the Rec.709 cube. Pull 1–2 after ETTR so the cube's mid-grey
  lands. Not camera EV. Persists with View Assist. iOS Share **Bake LUT**
  has a **Bake exposure** row (on by default) that writes that pull into
  the file; off keeps the cube at 0.0. Android share/save stays the original.

- Playback Auto LUT reads the shot profile from QuickTime Keys
  `com.dji.camera.ColorGammaSxS` (Mimo Color Recovery's field) on the
  **original** take. The 720p LRF/XRF sidecar is Rec.709 even for D-Log /
  D-Log2, so Auto was turning the cube off. When the original is not cached,
  a 2 MiB HTTP Range of its `moov` tail is enough. Last live D-Log / D-Log2
  is the fallback when that atom is missing. `colr`/`nclx` stays Rec.709 for
  log. A Rec.709 live SET no longer turns Auto off after you monitored log.
  Opening the LUT sheet in playback no longer restamps Auto from the body's
  current SET (that was applying live D-Log2 on a D-Log clip). Shot color is
  stored next to the cached clip (`color.json`) so Auto still binds when the
  camera is disconnected. A **Proxy** tag marks 720p-only cache. Storage has
  **Full Resolution Caching** (on by default) so opening a clip also pulls the
  original; off keeps only the proxy.

- LUT picker is DJI / Creative / Custom. Built-in Rec.709 conversions are
  gone. DJI Auto uses the official manufacturer cubes (and last live log
  color on playback). Creative is Mono / Contrast / Warm / Cool.

- Android closed-beta waitlist on the landing page. The Android CTA opens a dialog
  with the Tally signup (email required; Osmo and phone optional). Submissions stay
  in Tally, not git.

- Android playback LUT / PEAK / FALSE / ZEBRA grade in GLES on the 720p proxy
  (ExoPlayer → OES surface → `FeedEffectsGlProgram` → TextureView), same order
  as live. WAVE / HISTO tap that GL copy, not a TextureView `getBitmap`. Export
  still pulls the original 4K file.

- iOS playback LUT / PEAK / FALSE / ZEBRA follow live present order on the 720p
  proxy (`AVPlayerItemVideoOutput` 420 IOSurface → `LiveAssistEngine` →
  `CIFeedView` as a sibling of `AVPlayerLayer`). Preview LUT is not
  `AVVideoComposition` (export bake still is). The output asks for Metal
  420, not 32BGRA, so AVPlayer does not convert every HEVC frame to RGB.
  LUT replace hides the player once Metal owns the cube, matching live;
  overlay stripes keep the identity layer. Nesting Metal inside
  `AVPlayerLayer` presented LUT replace as a black plate (zebra / peaking
  still showed through). The look unhides only after a bake lands. SwiftUI
  `attach` no longer invalidates the in-flight cube. Auto LUT uses the last
  live color mode so a disconnected library clip still binds the D-Log /
  D-Log2 cube. Grade is GPU-only (no per-frame CPU blit). Pixel-buffer
  pulls run on `opv.playback-pull`. The LUT display link follows the
  display (24–120 Hz) and only bakes a new player frame — it is not
  capped at 24 fps.

- Shared `FeedPresentPolicy` (Swift core + Android lockstep): skip duplicate
  GPU timestamps, latest-wins if a bake is busy, freeze is a 2 s flag (keep
  the last sample — do not flush), replace-grade unhides the drawable before
  present, offscreen feeds disable Metal/GLES, and one `0x09/0xa8` write at a
  time (`SerialSessionGate`). Recreating the processed feed re-paints the last
  decoded buffer.

- LUT grade stays on the 720p working raster (cap 1440 px): 4K originals
  downscale before the cube, the baker pipelines the next frame, and the
  player stays as underlay so an empty Metal plate cannot black the monitor.
  Panel fit is bilinear. Next/prev keeps that host — a slide identity
  rebuild left LUT on a departing view until the chip was cycled.

- Shared Lucide HUD icon catalog (`OpcIcon`) on iOS and Android. The vendored set is 72 official
  24px stroke glyphs (plus a filled star). Pairing, media library, playback, LUT 50/50, chrome-edit
  eyes, live top deck / capture strip / battery / assist tools (zebra stripes stay custom),
  portrait fit-fill, and recovery chrome use the same paths. SF Symbols remain on settings
  sheets and a few playback destinations.
- Android clip player View Assist rail (independent of live, persisted as
  `OpenPocketCine.PlaybackAssists.v1`) and high-frame-rate conform preview
  (Real time + 23.976/24/25/29.97/30, muted, stretched time labels). GPU
  LUT/peaking/zebra on playback is still a follow-up; chips already toggle.
- Starlight protocol handbook for BLE pairing, camera Wi-Fi, and DUML at
  [openpocketcine.app/docs](https://openpocketcine.app/docs/) (`just handbook`
  locally). Markdown lives in `handbook/src/content/docs/`.
- **Face Priority** on the Auto EV sheet. On: the drum is grayed, EV follows
  faces to middle gray (median of several; fast third-stops for 2.5 s after a
  face appears, then one third-stop every 1 s), and a face mark sits on the EV
  label. Off restores the EV from before the toggle, or 0.0.
- Calculated shutter angle (5.6°–360°) on the SHUTTER sheet. The camera still
  takes 1/N; we convert from the live frame rate.
- ISO sheet **Auto Native ISO** toggle (default on). Off keeps ISO when switching
  D-Log ↔ D-Log2 instead of hopping 400 ↔ 1600.
- Shared Swift protocol core for DJI Osmo Pocket: DUML framing, BLE discovery, SoftAP join, and
  HEVC/AVC live-view depacketizing.
- iOS SwiftUI shell with saved cameras, live monitor chrome, and GPU assists (LUT import, peaking,
  zebra, false color, waveform, histogram, guides).
- Android Jetpack Compose shell in `Apps/Android/` consuming the same Swift core over JNI.
- Public repository hygiene: `just check`, secret scan, landing page at openpocketcine.app.
- README support note for optional [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/eriksutton)
  contributions, with a nod to animal charities.
- Landing-page and README media-library and playback mockups, with a Frame.io
  identification mark on clip upload.

### Fixed

- Pocket 3 initial AVC decode, Nano large-frame assembly and private metadata
  handling, plus bounded iOS Multiview foreground recovery. Pocket 3 recovery
  can still take about a minute after an app switch.
- iOS false-color continuity during exposure updates and video/assist alignment
  during rotation and Fit/Fill. D-Log M scopes now use direct signal levels in
  both shells; estimated scene stops are not calibrated sensor limits.
- Pocket 3 normal-video FORMAT choices include 2.7K and documented aspect/rate
  combinations when the camera does not supply capabilities. Reported tables
  retain priority; physical format/reconnect verification remains pending.

- Android WAITING FOR LIVE VIEW took 5–10 s after the 720p cube-then-stretch
  present (S25 / Pocket 4 Pro). Compiling `feed.frag` before the decoder
  surface, then on the ImageReader thread, missed `0x09/0xa8`. The
  constructor now creates ImageReader immediately; copy+blit compile on
  `opc.vk.gpu`; LUT pipes after the first picture. A failed GPU submit
  re-signals the present fence (frozen well, live HUD).

- Android live LUT still blotched D-Log2 next to iOS (S25 / Pocket 4 Pro).
  The 3D cube ran after bilinear-sampling 720p log RGB at the panel;
  iOS cubes at `bakeSize` (720p) then stretches Rec.709. Vulkan and the
  GLES fallback now cube at 720p, then blit that Rec.709 bake.

- Android live LUT looked like a chroma blotch next to iOS (S25 / Pocket
  4 Pro, D-Log2). The cube was an 8-column 2D atlas, so bilinear filtering
  mixed neighbouring blue slices — iOS uses `CIColorCube` (3D). Vulkan now
  uploads a 3D LUT and converts 4:2:0 1:1 at 720p (panel-rate 420 is the
  Adreno mosaic).

- Android live kept pixelated patches until something moved in that part
  of the frame (S25 / Pocket 4 Pro). Vulkan acquired the ImageReader
  AHB from the decoder but never released it, so static HEVC skip-blocks
  stayed in the GPU cache. Present now acquire/releases around the 720p
  YCbCr copy.

- Android Operator Setup over live view remounted the monitor (immersive
  system bars used two composition slots) and released MediaCodec while
  UDP stayed live — black well, no watchdog PLI. One content slot, and
  `setOutputSurface` failure rebuilds the decoder.

- Android live still looked pixelated with LUT off (S25 / Pocket 4 Pro).
  Operator Setup Fast was on, so every frame took the grade path, but
  Catmull-Rom was hard-coded off and an intermediate well sometimes stayed
  720p then stretched. Present now samples 720p RGB at the swapchain
  (Catmull-Rom when Fast; cube in the same pass when LUT is on).

- Android AF-C after ML Kit was a tad eager vs iOS. Lock now needs an eye
  landmark (`FaceStructurePolicy`), min face 0.10, and no ML Kit tracking
  IDs — `FaceTrackHold` owns the miss window.

- Android AF-C face lock was timid next to iOS Vision. The platform
  `FaceDetector` only finds frontal eyes and we fed it a 320×180 tap.
  Face AF now runs ML Kit (FAST, landmarks) on a 640×360 identity raster.

- Android WAITING FOR LIVE VIEW hung a GOP after connect. LiveViewScreen
  only exists once handshake publishes LIVE, and swapchain create compiled
  the LUT fragment shader on the UI thread before MediaCodec had a
  surface, so the enable IDR was dropped. The ImageReader now latches
  before that compile.

- Android live LUT looked pixelated against LUT-off (S25 / Pocket 4 Pro).
  The cube ran at 720p, then that contrast-stretched grid was scaled up.
  Present now bilinear-samples 720p RGB at the panel and applies the cube
  per display pixel, same scaler as identity.

- Android live face bracket sat on the opposite side of the subject on
  Vulkan. Detector PixelCopied the swapchain (already X-flipped when
  TT180/MIRROR is on) and the overlay mirrored again. Face AF now samples
  unmanaged 720p RGB, like iOS Vision on the identity VT buffer.

- Android live PEAK did not paint on the Vulkan path (S25 / Pocket 4 Pro).
  GLES already ran the 3-pass blur-radius detector; Vulkan graded LUT /
  FALSE / ZEBRA only. Live peaking now matches GLES/iOS: 720p re-blur,
  mask, closed stroke + hairline over identity (or over LUT).

- Nano COLOR SET/GET labelled `camcap_color_mode` `00 3F 3D` by list order
  (`00` D-Log M / `3F` Normal 8-bit / `3D` Normal 10-bit). Hardware is `00`
  Normal 8-bit / `3F` Normal 10-bit / `3D` D-Log M — the same `00`/`3D` as
  Pocket 3 Rec.709 / D-Log M. iOS and Android translate at the wire
  boundary (`family == nano`); ColorMode / COLOR_* semantic ids are
  unchanged.

- Pocket 3 COLOR SET/GET used Pocket 4 / Nano bytes: `00` was sent as D-Log M
  (the body took Rec.709), `3F` Normal was rejected, and `cam_image_effect`
  `@2` `3D` showed as Normal 10-bit (#176). Pocket 3 wire is now `00` Normal /
  `3C` HDR (HLG) / `3D` D-Log M on iOS and Android.

- Android live picture no longer goes black after Operator Setup or clips on
  API 34+ phones (#248, S25 Ultra / Pocket 4 Pro). Settings / media covering
  the monitor already kept pktType `0x02` ingest (#177); the SurfaceView still
  followed visibility and destroyed the Vulkan swapchain, and a failed
  reattach fell back to GLES (unbinding MediaCodec) while UDP stayed live so
  the watchdog never PLI'd. The live surface now stays attached under the
  overlay, a failed attach retries instead of abandoning Vulkan, and
  return-from-gallery treats leftover GOP packets as not a live picture.

- Pocket 3 media library after a take (#258): `/v2` always uses storage 0
  (single microSD), even when the list handle looks internal, and the newest
  catalog page still lists if enter-playback ACKs E0. Both shells.

- Renaming the Pocket SoftAP no longer joins the cached old SSID while the
  paired row shows the new BLE name (#257). Cached password is kept; a live
  advertised name that differs from Keychain / Keystore wins. Scan rows
  update when the BLE local name changes. Both shells.

- LUT 50/50 split dropped live view and stayed on Reconnecting until
  force-quit (#218): split without a cube was treated as replace-grade
  (empty Metal over HEVC), and overlapping LUT bakes blocked MainActor on
  `nextDrawable`, which starved HEVC ingest. 50/50 is a LUT option only
  (same gate as Android); Metal presents latest-wins with one drawable in
  flight and does not block. Toggling 50/50 does not GOP-reset. iOS present
  path; Android already skipped GPU split without a cube.

- First pair could never join the Pocket SoftAP again after a camera Wi-Fi
  reset (#235, #216): Wi-Fi credentials were cached before the join and kept
  through every failed join, so a regenerated passphrase was never re-read
  (Keychain survives reinstall; the wizard has no Forget). Credentials now
  persist only after a successful join, and a failed join with cached
  credentials drops them so the next tap re-reads them over BLE. A 5.8 GHz
  SoftAP in a DFS region (UK) beacons only after a ~60 s channel availability
  check, which is why Mimo "takes forever" there; one hotspot apply gave up
  in ~20 s with Unable to join. Both shells now keep applying the join for
  90 s, and the copy says 2.4 GHz joins at once. The connect spine (`creds:`,
  `wifi:` with the hotspot error code, `session: connect failed`) now lands
  in the diagnostics journal; a `joiningWifi` report used to carry no line
  about why. Both shells.

- Pocket 3 first picture still black until FORMAT or COLOR changed (#221,
  #147): the 1080→boot-4K poke waited 2 s then SETs a guessed 4K 30 if
  `cam_video_param_v2` had not landed, marked the poke done, and never
  retried. Wait for the legal FORMAT table (or 8 s), pick a pair from
  `camcap_video_format`, and only then mark the one-shot used. `feed:
  first-picture` lands in `control-live.log`. Both shells.

- Live feed that stalled and never came back (#218, #219, #216 family): the
  mid-session stall ladder now ends in a new datalink handshake on the same
  SoftAP (enable ×2 on encoder pause → one UDP rebuild → rejoin, last frame
  held) instead of session-preserving UDP rebuilds every 60 s under a
  Reconnecting chip. A rejoin that misses its handshake starts bounded session
  recovery (warm rehandshake, BLE reconnect, then the operator) instead of
  leaving a live phase with no datalink until force-quit. Any tracked camera
  SET (record, FORMAT, COLOR, WB, tracking box) now holds stall repair 4 s the
  same way AF-C / zoom / gimbal already did, so a long-press track or a chip
  tap cannot GOP-cut or rebind a live picture. Both shells.

- Highlight zebra (#136): the stripe now reads the frame's max channel,
  the same byte WAVE draws at 100, instead of Rec.709 luma. A blue-led hot
  sky whose luma sat under its hot channel never painted at 100. Factory
  Highlight is now **99 IRE** ("approaching clip"): 100 is the live-tap
  ceiling byte itself (D-Log2 247) and the ceiling ratchets to the frame
  max, so a typical 243–247 D-Log2 shelf missed it. Saved thresholds are
  untouched. Both shells; GLES, Vulkan, Core Image and the Android CPU look.
- iOS session recovery keeps the held frame across every reconnect
  attempt after a camera power cycle (#193). `run()` reset the decoder
  (`flushAndRemoveImage`) on each attempt, so the Reconnecting card sat
  over a black well; Android already skipped that reset while holding
  the monitor. Recovery outcomes (`session: drop` / `recovery attempt
  failed phase=…` / `stalled` / `recovered` / `exhausted`) now also land
  in `Documents/control-live.log` so a TestFlight log names the stuck
  stage.
- Live VideoToolbox (LUT / WAVE / PEAK / Face AF on) now asks
  `VTDecompressionSessionCanAcceptFormatDescription` when the camera sends new
  same-raster VPS/SPS (zoom, FORMAT, D-Log2 → D-Log hop) and rebuilds the
  session only on refusal, keeping the last picture. A kept session that
  refused the new sets failed every frame silently: frozen well, live HUD
  (#148, #194). Async VT decode errors are now counted, and the observe line's
  `decoderWedged` means an error after the last presented frame rather than
  any error this session.
- Android live picture no longer goes black after opening clips or
  Operator Setup (#177). Settings / media covering the monitor must not
  drop pktType `0x02` — Pocket has no periodic GOP, and the watchdog
  will not PLI while UDP video is still arriving. Return-from-gallery
  now uses the captured live-start (`0x02/0x68` then `0x09/0xa8` + IDR
  hold) instead of a raw enable write.
- Android live handshake miss is no longer an uncaught `IllegalStateException`
  (`error("camera never answered the datalink handshake")`, Play Vitals on
  Android 16 / #189). `DatalinkDriver.open` throws `DatalinkError.NoHandshake`
  like iOS `DatalinkError.noHandshake`. SoftAP still up → retry; path gone →
  pairing kick from connect, or a logged recovery miss that keeps the last
  frame. Production handshake / first-picture / enable-once gates go through
  JNI `cameraSoftAPDecision` (`CameraSoftAP`) so Kotlin is not a second ladder
  (#114). SoftAP `onLost` still holds `isProcessBound` through the 8 s
  reassociation grace (the Network object is dead; the process bind is not).
  Handshake `open()` timeout covers four UDP binds instead of racing 30 s.
- Android live Vulkan no longer aborts when leaving the monitor, rotating,
  or opening clips: `surfaceDestroyed` now drops the swapchain before the
  window mutex is destroyed, in-flight `nativeSubmit` drains before
  `nativeDestroy`, and a present after detach is a skip rather than a
  process abort (`vkQueuePresentKHR` destroyed mutex, `vkCreateImage`
  during submit, `DestroySwapchainKHR` on release).
- Auto ISO Rec.709 range labels start at 50 on Pocket 3 / Pocket 4 and 100
  on Pocket 4 Pro. The ceiling SET is unchanged — picking 100–400 on a
  Pocket 3 was already 50–400 on the camera (#180).
- Android clip playback no longer copies the LRF/XRF sidecar into RAM.
  A missing Content-Length used to grow `ByteArrayOutputStream` until
  `OutOfMemoryError` (Play Vitals, #188). Proxies stream to disk like
  originals; RAM GETs (thumbs) cap at 8 MiB.
- View Assist long-press options lift above the keyboard when a number
  field is focused (Zebra Highlight / Midtone). The number pad has a
  Done accessory; tap outside still dismisses the popup. Live and
  playback, iOS and Android (#135).
- Android handshake miss is no longer an uncaught `IllegalStateException`
  (`error()` in `DatalinkDriver.open`). SoftAP `onLost` still counts as
  path-ready during reassociation grace, so the miss rebinds UDP instead
  of crashing. After the path is gone, the session retries or returns to
  pairing (#189). Android 16 Vitals on S24-class devices.

- Head tracking closes on a dead-reckoned gimbal model with target-rate
  feed-forward instead of live `0x04/0x05`. Live attitude is ~0.25 s
  stale at ~10 Hz, and a proportional loop closed on it limit-cycled —
  the 17:10 take shows the gimbal blowing ~9° past a parked head and
  bobbing back. Full linear stick measures ~40°/s (Fast); stale
  telemetry only bleeds drift out of the model, is adopted once
  provably stationary, and is ignored while dead (`@20` froze mid-nod,
  replacing the frozen-tilt rest hack; yaw froze 8 s in the 18:29 take).
  The debug HUD gains a `pred` row — the model pose — for retuning
  `stickRateDegPerSec` on device.

- Head-track look is the SET-relative nose azimuth/elevation again:
  Euler Δatt yaw wobbles when nodding at a yawed heading, dragging pan
  diagonally through a vertical nod (18:29 take). The `panIsolateDeg`
  nod guard existed to mask that wobble and instead froze real pan
  error (a 15° stuck offset while nodding near SET) — removed.

- Head-track model rate corrected to the measured wire ceiling: a rvi0
  capture of Mimo's own joystick at Fast shows ~67°/s on both axes
  (the first 40°/s estimate read decaying throw as full throw), so
  full-stick catch-up now actually delivers 67°/s. ±550 is the wire's
  valid range, not a UI limit — a 1.6x over-travel build made the
  gimbal slow and jerky because the camera drops out-of-range stick
  frames instead of clamping. The handle joystick's ~82°/s is an
  internal channel `0x04/0x01` cannot reach.

- Head-track arrival streams center for ~1 s before lifting the stick.
  Arriving fast and lifting immediately made every gesture pause a
  grab/release cycle; rest→throw in the same second paused HEVC at
  18:29:47 (4 recovers and 2 UDP rebuilds to get the picture back).
  A real stop still lifts, so sustained center never streams.

- Head tracking look is AirPods Euler yaw/pitch from Calibrate Head
  Lock, not a quaternion nose. Stick throw is live gimbal error onto
  that look until they match. Rest lifts the stick.

- Head-track gimbal pitch ring reads `0x04/0x05` i16 `@20` (negated). A
  Mimo tilt take showed stick-down making `@20` positive; `@2` stayed 0
  and `@6` stayed ~13°.

- ACK groups 1–2 treat seq `0` as a real cursor: 34-byte `0x01` no longer
  rewinds group 1 after `0x03` has been seen (that muted SET/Flip while
  HEVC stayed live). Android UDP rebuild re-arms `0x02` ingest so keepalive
  / SoftAP reassociate cannot drop every video packet as leftover GOP.
  Tracked SETs no longer burn seq on a skipped write; Android seq+send
  serializes off Main. Same-raster BLA/IDR no longer tears MediaCodec.
  Watchdog retries a silent 9004 after the 60 s rebuild backoff even if
  BLE keepalive is young. Mid-session IDR hold releases once UDP is alive
  and a picture is on the layer. Gallery resume never `0x09/0xa8` while
  still in playback.

- Window ACK group 0 is latest `0x02` seq: 34-byte `0x01` no longer rewinds
  it after video has been seen, and seq `0` is not treated as missing.
  Live-view enable is untracked so `0xa8` still leaves on UDP `.waiting`.
  Rebuild ingest is generation-gated; leftover GOP from the old socket
  cannot mix into the new assembler. Stick rest can still emit while
  `liveAccepting` is down.

- SET mailbox matches ACK seq before a 0x8E GET waiter, so FOV/ISO-limit
  SET replies are not stolen (that waitLate then rebuilt UDP). Track-poll
  `0xA5` and skipped UDP writes are not uplink death. Photo/Record
  `waitLate` still clears `controlBusy`.

- Foreground recover no longer tears a live GOP: young HEVC or status on
  9004 skips UDP rebuild, and the post-enable escalate wait is the 8 s
  IDR grace (2 s discarded the new bind). Handshake keeps the socket when
  inbound 0x02/0x01 beat the 0x00 ACK. First-picture does not PLI a
  picture that already presented. Session recovery starts only on BLE /
  SoftAP loss.

- Pocket live GOP is often HEVC BLA_W_LP (NAL 16), not only IDR_N_LP (20).
  iOS IDR hold now releases on IRAP 16–21 so a live BLA picture is not
  frozen while UDP stays young. Duplicate UDP fragments no longer mark
  the whole AU corrupt.

- One live-repair Task at a time: do not cancel an in-flight UDP rebuild
  (the cancelled body still force-enabled after `await`). Mid-session
  `still holding for IDR` extra `0x09/0xa8` is gone — `FeedWatchdog.tick`
  owns encoder-pause. Analog/head-track treat `lastVideo=none` after a
  live GOP as stale and lift on every recover. UDP rebuild nils status
  clocks so the old 5-tuple cannot look like encoder-pause. Android SET
  timeout rebuild matches iOS (`statusFresh`), and stick notify rides the
  ACK thread instead of a Main 25 Hz job.

- Android UDP rebuild lowers the 0x02 ingest gate and re-arms after
  enable (leftover TRAIL P mixed into the new GOP). SoftAP reassociate
  rebuilds the 5-tuple without a force `0x09/0xa8` if HEVC already
  existed. DUML SET/stick seq+write take `sendLock`.

- A held gimbal stick no longer blocks recover forever (throw stamp was
  refreshing every 40 ms). Grace caps at stall+3 s of dead HEVC. Analog
  and head-track lift when video is stale. Center encode is rest, not a
  25 Hz center stream. Android stick tap-slop matches iOS (0.18).

- Encoder-pause recover: two enables, then one UDP rebuild; do not
  GOP-cut every 5 s for a minute when BLE notify is stale. Rebuild
  backoff is 60 s even if `lastBle` is old.

- Live UDP writes (SET, ACK, stick, Flip GET) serialize on the datalink
  queue so a MainActor SET cannot starve the 40 Hz window ACK. SET ACK
  timeout no longer tears UDP while DUML status is young (encoder pause
  looked like a dead uplink). Keepalive rebuild no longer GOP-cuts with
  `0x09/0xa8` when video had already existed. After UDP rebuild, re-arm
  pktType `0x02` ingest if live view was already accepting. Android JNI
  watchdog now parses gimbal-throw grace (`secondsSinceGimbalThrow`) so
  a stick throw does not GOP-cut the feed.

- Head tracking lifts the gimbal stick when catch-up rests (Mimo: `0x04/0x01`
  only while thrown). Streaming center at 25 Hz after a 1:1 close paused
  HEVC at 15–30 s; two enables then a UDP rebuild plus keepalive flaps
  looked like a dropped connection while status stayed live. Encoder-pause
  with young DUML status no longer rebuilds UDP; keepalive does not flap
  the 5-tuple. A leftover `y=-0.01` after close encodes as center
  (`axisLinear` snap) — treat it as rest, debounce the lift 0.3 s so
  grab/release chatter does not cut GOP, and stop commanding tilt if live
  pitch `@6` never leaves SET. After a 1:1 close, live-yaw wiggle must
  not re-grab the stick. Two failed encoder-pause enables now rebuild
  UDP once (22:16 brought the picture back); keepalive still will not
  flap while status is live. Look-at throw is full Mimo stick (±550)
  with `0x04/0x50` Fast + Follow (tilt unlocked) at Calibrate Head Lock
  — half-stick plus a 0.8 s pitch-stuck park was the crawl / limited nod.
  Catch-up is full stick until close (not error/10°, which was a 10× crawl).

- Head tracking yaw and pitch follow the head (AirPods `+rotationRate.y`
  is look-left; `+pitch` is nod down — both inverted onto stick right/up).
  Catch-up throw is capped at half stick so a 90° look does not hold full
  `0x04/0x01` and pause HEVC. Rest the stick when video goes silent; if two
  encoder-pause enables leave the picture dead, rebuild UDP after 15 s
  (status staying young used to sit in cooldown forever).

- AirPods head tracking pan integrates head-turn gyro from Calibrate Head
  Lock (attitude yaw and nose-vector lookRight both topped out ~5–10° on
  a 90° turn). Nod is inverted attitude pitch onto stick tilt-up.

- AirPods head tracking no longer lifts the gimbal stick every time the
  head is still. Rest is center while calibrated. Lift/grab chatter was
  pausing HEVC (status stayed live, watchdog `encoderPaused`, then
  `0x09/0xa8` RECOV about a second after Calibrate Head Lock).

- AirPods head tracking takes look from the SET-relative nose vector
  (quaternion). A vertical nod no longer zigzags pan from Euler yaw
  coupling. Looking past a mechanical stop still rests the stick.

- AirPods head tracking projects unbounded look onto the Pocket
  controllable pan/tilt box (−235°…+58° pan, −120°…+70° tilt). Looking
  past a mechanical stop rests the stick; looking back is 1:1 from SET
  again — it does not keep throwing and walk the center.

- Live gimbal stick (on-screen, gamepad, and iOS AirPods look-at) no longer
  writes `0x04/0x01` from the main thread. Stick notify rides the 40 Hz UDP
  ACK queue at 25 Hz; AirPods IMU stays off main and applies at that rate.
  MainActor stick + 100 Hz headphone motion was starving window ACK so the
  picture dropped and did not recover.

- Zoom in/out no longer drops the live picture while HUD and gimbal stay up.
  Same-raster VPS/SPS (zoom / FORMAT) does not tear the decoder or IDR-hold
  without `0x09/0xa8`, and the watchdog holds 4 s after a zoom SET the way
  it already does for AF-C.

- First picture no longer sits on WAITING FOR LIVE VIEW when persisted LUT
  or WAVE starts VT: if the identity layer already presented, that VT still
  gets a PLI. In-flight VPS/IDR access units are not dropped while MainActor
  is busy with Flip/GET.

- First picture ingest pktType `0x02` on UDP handshake ack, not on
  `0x09/0xa8`. Mimo is on-screen ~17 ms after SoftAP DHCP; enable at +3 s
  is a later PLI. Waiting for live view no longer sits through an 8 s IDR
  grace on an already-rolling feed.

- White balance Auto keeps tint (`0x02/0x2C` `00 00 00 <tint>`), matching Mimo.
  Auto no longer zeros tint, and a missed ACK no longer reverts the WB HUD.
  Kelvin/tint drums are latest-wins (one SET in flight, 100 ms coalesce) so a
  scrub cannot flood unacked writes. Tint while Auto stays Auto.

- FORMAT and zoom chips follow the connected body. FORMAT tabs/drum come from
  `camcap_video_format` (Pocket 4 Pro Video is 4K/1080 24–60; SlowMo 100/120/240
  is not a labeled Video SET). Zoom chips: Pocket 4 Pro 1×/3×/6×/12×; Pocket 4
  1×/2×/4× (no second tele); Pocket 3 1×/2×/4× but 4K Video max 2×; Nano 1×.
  SlowMo / TimeLapse / SuperNight lock digital zoom (Pro keeps 1×/3× optical).

- COLOR drum follows the connected body. D-Log2 (`0x41`) is Pocket 4 Pro only.
  Pocket 4 is Normal / HDR / D-Log; Pocket 3 is Normal / HDR (HLG) / D-Log M
  (`0x00` — `0x17` D-Log showed "colour 4" and crashed the stream). Nano stays
  the captured 8-bit / 10-bit / D-Log M wheel. (#160)

- Pocket 3 first picture: 4K 25/30 boot with HUD and gimbal live stayed
  black until the operator switched FORMAT to 1080 and back to 4K. Same-tab
  FORMAT is a no-op, so that `0x02/0x18` round-trip never left the wire.
  After one failed enable, first-picture recovery now SETs the other labeled
  resolution, restores the boot 4K, then sends one `0x09/0xa8`. Pocket 4 /
  4 Pro stay on the enable / UDP ladder. (#147)

- Zoom while recording in D-Log2: the chip now grays (same 0.4 as interface
  lock) but stays hittable. Chip tap and pinch toast
  `Can't change color while recording — D-Log2 can't zoom` and do not send
  zoom or a color hop — the body will not change color while rolling. Color
  drum while recording uses the same lock. D-Log / Rec.709 / HLG still zoom
  while rolling. Idle D-Log2 still hops to D-Log off 1×. The control toast
  parks under the mounted top bar in DISP 1 and on the feed edge in DISP 2
  (follows the operator's DISP map if that bar is shown or hidden).
- Live WAVE / PARADE / HISTO / VECTOR tracked the picture at 15 Hz (10 Hz
  with three or more), so traces held about two SoftAP frames. Nominal tap
  is 25 Hz with 1–2 scopes; dense 3+ stays 10 Hz; thermal still ×3 / ×5.
  Downsample is 200-wide (213×120 on 720p). Android Vulkan walks the tap
  off the image thread so 25 Hz cannot stall the well.
- Gimbal stick pan matches the **live** picture. Invert pan on every
  rotate-180 (`FE 09`), latched when the 180 arrives (Mimo). Joystick yaw
  to 180 does not invert. Extra-mirror live HEVC when TT180 and Control
  Center Selfie Flip is off (`0x8E` pid `0x0038` `00`); Flip on skips
  extra-mirror so the monitor stays readable like Mimo. Invert latches at
  the end of the 180, not at the 90° midpoint. XOR the MIRROR chip.
  Reconnect at 180 seeds TT180 from attitude (a 0° stub does not lock
  front) and inverts without another triple-tap. Pid `0x38` GET is
  untracked on the live UDP ACK pump (~1 Hz) and does not complete
  audio / glamour `0x8E` waiters (a session Task plus a `.ready`-only
  write used to freeze Flip after a few seconds while video kept
  moving). Keepalive BLE Flip GET when UDP replies go stale (≥2 s).
  Window ACK group 1 echoes the latest pktType-`0x03`
  transport seq (Mimo). That window is every command reply (Flip
  GET, other `0x8E`, record/stop, zoom ACK), not Flip alone;
  repeating handshake `baseSeq` there filled it while HEVC and
  `0x01` HUD kept moving, so SET/GET went stale and a session-
  preserving UDP rebuild could not restore controls. Extra-mirror
  holds the last picture for three frames (~120 ms) before
  X-flipping so the current orientation is not mirrored in place.
- Disconnected library Auto LUT keeps the clip's D-Log / D-Log2 cube. Opening
  the LUT sheet no longer restamps Auto from a missing live SET (that showed
  “No matching look for this color / camera” on a log clip). Color is
  re-read when Full Resolution Caching finishes the original.
- iPad hides the system time / battery bar. The HUD status chips stay.
- Gimbal stick and zoom chip are one **gimbal cluster** in every orientation:
  zoom stacks above the stick in the trailing-bottom of the 16:9 well, not
  glued to the record button. On iPad landscape the cluster sits on the
  right edge above record (it used to slide left, and before that drop
  off-screen). Follow / speed / A·B·C will sit leading of the stick in
  that same cluster.
- Playback Share is the same chrome as the other transport actions while the
  original is still on camera (the sheet caches first). The portrait share
  card hugs its options instead of filling to the status bar.
- Next/prev clip with LUT still on rebakes the look without cycling the chip.
  The playback Metal host stays put. The first pull often ran before the new
  item had a pixel buffer, then display-link ticks would not resubmit, so the
  cube stayed armed in chrome until the chip was toggled. Force-pull until
  this item presents.
- Android playback drops Kyant. The transport plate is 82% DJI black so type
  reads; the top row is back + filename + star with no bar. Chrome lives in
  the same overlay as the video gestures so transport buttons receive taps.
  Clip playback prefers the LRF/XRF proxy even when the 4K original is already
  cached. LUT / FALSE / PEAK / ZEBRA update the GLES plan in place — they do
  not swap ExoPlayer's output surface.
- Android playback chrome and View Assist now sample the clip. Kyant cannot
  see a TextureView, so WAVE / HISTO tap a 480 px `TextureView.getBitmap`
  copy. LUT is not that overlay.
- Android share sheet is DJI black at 94% (not Kyant frost) with a denser
  scrim so type reads over a clip. It is a Dialog at the top of the screen so
  clip-nav popups cannot draw over it. Playback chrome is its own Popup so
  tap-to-play does not steal transport buttons.
- Android playback View Assist uses the Lucide monitor glyph. Assist overlays
  sit in a Popup above the TextureView so grid / guides / scopes actually
  paint.
- Opening an Android clip no longer native-crashes. Playback glass recorded
  the box that also owned `liveChromeGlass`, so Kyant recursed in HWUI
  `prepareTree`. The recorded well is now a sibling of the chrome.
- Live HEVC is held while Media / Settings cover the monitor. Portrait media
  header stacks the item count under the title. The library overlay is
  z-indexed above live chrome so the record button cannot be tapped through
  it.
- Android live FPS chip now counts presented Vulkan frames over wall time.
  It used to sample `lastPresentedAt` every 40 ms, so the readout could not
  exceed ~25 fps. Datalink no longer `Log.i`s every HEVC fragment. ImageReader
  AHB Vulkan imports are cached instead of `vkCreateImage` every frame.
- Android live identity path (assists off) blits the hardware HEVC AHB
  straight to the swapchain. Tools-off no longer runs two YCbCr copies, a
  1280×720 histogram, a grade pass, and a CPU readback every frame — that
  was ~25 fps on S25. Decoder prefers `c2.qti` / Exynos over `c2.android`.
- Live view no longer paces decode at 30 fps. Android MediaCodec stamps
  wall-clock PTS with low-latency / realtime hints (was `KEY_FRAME_RATE` 30
  and +33.3 ms), and iOS sample timing uses a 60 kHz clock plus
  `DisplayImmediately`, so a 4K 50p body can present 50 Hz 720p HEVC like Mimo.
- Clip export downloads and shares the original camera file (4K HEVC), not the
  720p LRF/XRF playback proxy. iOS LUT bake uses HEVC-highest at the source
  raster instead of `AVAssetExportPresetHighestQuality` (720p/1080p cap).
- Android portrait Fill center-crops the 16:9 live picture into the fill well
  (iOS `fillCrop` / `feed.height * 16/9`) instead of stretching it vertically.
- Android Pocket screen flip (vertical live raster) matches iOS: new VPS/SPS
  rebuilds MediaCodec, `EncoderPresentPath.isVertical` pillarboxes 9:16 in the
  cinema well, and a second `0x09/0xa8` is skipped when the AU already carries
  the IDR.
- Android live scopes overlay the full canvas (iOS `LiveScopeOverlays`) so they
  can sit outside the feed well; drag uses root-space translation so portrait
  layout changes do not leave the panel behind the finger.

- Android first picture no longer sends gallery `0x02/0x0c` before every
  `0x09/0xa8` (that left handshake+telemetry up and `videoPkts=0`). First-picture
  recover also keeps running after a SoftAP flap: scene-inactive during
  `holdsMonitor` no longer latches a forever skip, stray playback still enables
  this tick, and UDP rebuild waits before the next enable.
- First connect no longer sits on Waiting for live-view when HEVC freezes
  after a P-frame burst while status is still alive.
- Stick pan while a subject is tracked matches the free gimbal (left is left).
- A live-view enable that produces no video packets rebuilds UDP after 2 s
  instead of holding an 8 s IDR window (the 15 s black well after leaving a
  clip).
- LUT 50/50 stays pinned when the catalog scrolls, so landscape no longer hides
  it.
- AUDIO Channel, Wind, Dir, and Vocal stay on the value you pick instead of
  bouncing back to the previous DSP snapshot.

### Changed

- FORMAT lists every `camcap_video_format` pair the body advertises, not only
  1080p / 4K 16:9. Catalog labels cover Nano 2.7K/4:3, Pocket 3 1:1/9:16/2.7K,
  Pocket 4 / 4 Pro 9:16 3K, Action 6 4K 1:1, and SlowMo 100/120/240. Unknown
  res/fps bytes still appear (hex tab) instead of being dropped. When the
  table has more than one aspect, FORMAT shows aspect chips then size tabs.
  Empty camcap still falls back to 1080 / 4K 16:9. Aspect is the resolution
  byte (`docs/osmo-recording-formats.md`). The sheet and chip stay on the
  tapped pair until `cam_video_param_v2` reports it — other HUD pushes no
  longer bounce the picker back to the previous size/aspect.

- Public copy names optional clip delivery **Frame.io upload** (Platform API v4).

- Idle D-Log2 zoom hops to D-Log (`0x02/0x42`) on the first step off 1×
  and holds every zoom `0xB8` until `cam_image_effect` is D-Log. The chip
  stays at live 1× until that hop lands (R2/L2, pinch, and the cycle
  chip). An optimistic color pin no longer lets the multiplier move
  while the body is still D-Log2. iOS and Android.

  covers protocol, iOS and Android apps, and setup — not protocol only. Same-PR
  update rule: `handbook/src/content/docs/contribute/documentation.md`.

- Android live scopes match iOS `ScopeMiniChrome` / `WaveformMovablePanel`:
  DJI-black 72% plates (`LiveDesign.scopePlate`). WAVE / PARADE / VECTOR /
  HISTO paint fill and traces in one Compose Canvas (iOS `plusLighter` on
  `compositingGroup`) — no plot hole, no second 0.72 plate over the
  traces, no Vulkan overlay. WAVE / PARADE / VECTOR bake the 0.72 plate
  and additive traces into one full-panel bitmap (nearest-neighbor blit)
  so gutters match the plot and ticks are not bilinear-boxed. WAVE /
  PARADE / VECTOR traces blit into the live plot rect (iOS
  `WaveformAxis.plotRect` gutters stay 26/6 dp) so L-scale cannot push
  IRE 100 off the guide. The baked image is plot-sized and transparent
  aside from ticks (Plus onto one plate) so the plot is not a second
  0.72 square. Scope
  chrome matches iOS `ScopeMiniChrome` (shadow outside, one clip, overlay
  hairline) so `shadow`+clip+Offscreen+border no longer stacks a thick
  inner edge. WAVE /
  PARADE accumulate off the UI thread at 250×153; VECTOR at 190×190.
  Compose only blits. The 1280×720→213×120 tap blit runs on the 10–15 Hz
  sample tick, not every HEVC frame. Last touched or moved panel stacks
  on top. Scopes sit above the feed and the focus / tracking box, under
  the top deck, View Assist bar, and camera-value strip. Hold 0.3 s then
  drag. Hold timeout is Compose `AwaitPointerEventScope.withTimeoutOrNull`
  (kotlinx `withTimeout` cancelled the pointerInput so move/scale never
  started). Drag uses `positionChange` so a moving offset does not jitter.
  L-corner hit well is 90 dp with 40 dp outside the clip. HISTO is Compose
  Canvas like iOS `HistogramScopePlot`. The pinch well stays under the
  panels.
- Android WAVE / PARADE traces use iOS additive `plusLighter` blending (not
  src-alpha), luma hot ticks, HISTO a shared RGBL peak plus luma stroke, and
  the WAVE IRE plot gutter so 0 / 100 sit on the same edges as iOS.
- Android AF-C face box size eases with a 0.70 s time constant so detector
  jitter does not resize the bracket every tick. Pinch hops D-Log2 → D-Log on
  any step off 1× before `0xB8` (iOS `dropDLog2ForZoom`), not only on the
  first magnification=1 begin event.
- Android AF-C face brackets drop after 0.22 s without a hit (iOS
  `FaceTrackHold.missTimeout`) instead of hanging on empty glass. Live pinch
  uses `ScaleGestureDetector` on a full-canvas well over the Vulkan SurfaceView
  (iOS `MagnifyGesture`), cumulative 1…12×, 20 Hz slider.
- Android ActiveTrack cancel (x) sits on the tracking box's top-right corner
  (iOS `LiveTrackingChrome.cancelRect`), not offset in mixed dp/px.
- Android live pinch-zoom uses an iOS-style hit well over the Vulkan
  SurfaceView and pipelines `0xB8` sliders at 20 Hz. Face AF runs on the live
  picture (AF-C after first frame) so brackets appear and a tap starts
  ActiveTrack, matching iOS Vision face tracking.
- Android live camera SETs match iOS `fireCamera`: latest-wins mailbox, 300 ms
  retransmit, 2 s settle, no `"Color timed out"` (or any SET timeout) toast, no
  HUD revert on a missed ACK. Color `0x02/0x42` hops Native ISO immediately
  (D-Log 400 ↔ D-Log2 1600) instead of waiting on the color ACK. GET / audio /
  tap-focus round-trips match iOS `requestCamera` (`announce: false`).
- Android landscape FORMAT and COLOR hang 8 dp under the top-deck chips at 340 dp
  (iOS `LiveTopPickerHost`) instead of filling down to the assist bar. Color SET
  is optimistic with a 2 s pin; D-Log2 still drops to D-Log on the zoom cycle.
- Android live zoom matches iOS `CamFov`: chip 1×/3×/6×/12×, pinch slider per
  lens tick, hybrid readout (12287 is 1×), D-Log2 hop off 1×.
- Android feed tracking matches iOS ActiveTrack: hold-drag search box, tap a
  face bracket to lock, `0xA6` SET / `0xA5` poll / `0x89` subject push, green
  cancel, focus reset.

- Android SHUTTER sheet speed / angle / EV / Face Priority logic matches iOS:
  the wheel is the camera `camcap_shutter` list, the angle ladder is calculated
  5.6°–360° and mapped to a legal 1/N at live fps, Auto expo turns the tile
  into EV third-stops (−3.0…+3.0), Face Priority greys the drum and restores
  EV when turned off, and the sheet reseats on cap-list / fps / expo mode —
  not every live 1/N tick. Shutter SET stays `u16 denom | 0x8000`.
- Android first-picture no longer holds a UDP rebuild for 8 s just because
  status/0x03 is fresh. That left WAITING FOR LIVE VIEW with `videoPkts=0`
  (the same healthy-telemetry / dead-HEVC bind iOS already rebuilds).
- Android live picker / assist / capture popups use the same `liveChromeGlass`
  ND plate as the HUD (not an opaque black slab), the circular glass close,
  centered LUT caption, and the LUT 50/50 circle at 16 dp. Every View Assist
  options sheet uses the LUT chrome: 27 dp close, 12 dp pad / 8 dp gap, and a
  well from a 12 dp top margin down to the assist bar (short menus hug; LUT
  still fills so the drum can grow, 0.12 / 0.88 fade, 50/50 pinned). Assist
  option rows stack in a column (PEAK / FALSE / ZEBRA no longer paint on top
  of each other). Capture ISO / shutter / WB / format / color drums use the
  same 27 dp close, pad, fade, and fill-the-well drum so neighbours peek.
  Drum faces 27/20 pt, and 50/50 is ~20% smaller than the iOS 34 / 30 / 14
  tokens so the compact S25 card matches the baseline photo.
  Picker / assist cards keep HUD glass plus a 0.20 black ND so the catalog is
  a tad less see-through than the bars, and sample the scene backdrop so
  liquid glass blurs chrome under the sheet (not only the live well).
- In-app Disconnect on iOS now matches Android teardown: `DatalinkDriver.close()`
  is terminal (callbacks dropped, UDP generation bumped), VideoToolbox is
  invalidated and the display layer flushed, and a cancelled `open()` cannot
  publish LIVE after the operator already left. Process death used to be the
  only reliable reconnect; leftover UDP receive was why Waiting for live view
  stuck until the app was killed.
- Android live view paints LUT, peaking, false colour, and zebra on the
  HEVC picture through GLES (`GL_TEXTURE_EXTERNAL_OES` to `FeedEffectsGlProgram`),
  including 50/50 log-vs-LUT when that comparison is armed.
- Android live stall recovery uses a **stateful** Swift `FeedWatchdog`
  handle over JNI instead of a fresh idle tick every second.
- Android SoftAP `onLost` no longer unbinds the process (or reports the
  path ready) until reassociation grace ends, so UDP rebuild cannot leak
  onto home Wi-Fi. Failed datagram sends now flag `needsRebuild`. ISO
  Auto / EV / AF-S chips match iOS; live assist state is shared with
  Operator Setup.
- Privacy and Terms on iOS and Android open the live website pages
  (`openpocketcine.app/privacy/`, `/terms/`) instead of in-app stubs.
  Licenses and NOTICE stay in-app.
- Android Operator Setup and media library use solid panel frost instead of
  Kyant liquid glass. Liquid glass stays on the live HUD, where it can
  sample the feed.
- Android on-feed gimbal stick follows the same compact chrome scale as the
  record rail (0.935 on S25-class 360 dp) instead of staying 88 dp.
- Android view-assist chips match iOS `AssistToolChip` when on: accent-dim
  fill plus a 1 pt accent stroke.
- Android landscape view-assist bar grows into the leftover beside the
  camera-settings pill so the tools sit a 12 dp gutter from ISO rather than
  leaving an empty gap.
- Android live battery pills match iOS `LiveBatteryRow`: 26×15 outline, bolt
  glyph, and the percent scales/clips inside the cell instead of spilling
  past the stroke.
- Android no longer treats a SoftAP `onLost` a few seconds after join as a
  full disconnect. Like OpenZCine, it waits for the Network object to
  reassociate, rebinds UDP, and only drops the session if the camera AP is
  still gone after 8 s.
- Android datalink follows the handbook / iOS 9004 5-tuple: unbound UDP
  pinned to the SoftAP Network then `connect` to `192.168.2.1:9004`, and a
  40 Hz pktType-`0x04` window ACK that echoes the latest video transport
  seq (that is what keeps the camera's HEVC send window open). Handshake
  then register/subscribe/`0x09/0xa8` in one turn. SoftAP `onLost` waits
  for reassociation. Pre-join Wi-Fi scan waits at most 3 s then requests.
- Android live capture strip (ISO / shutter / mode / WB / focus / audio)
  uses a wider gap between cells.
- Android live HUD glass matches iOS `liveChromeGlass`: black ND tint over a
  DJI-black plate so the feed cannot bleach the pills. Titan gray as a glass
  tint desaturated refraction instead of darkening it.
- Android live-view enable and UDP ACK/keepalive no longer run on the
  main thread (StrictMode was dropping `0x09/0xa8`, so the camera never
  sent HEVC and the HUD stayed on Waiting for live view). UDP binds IPv4.
- Android uses the iOS landing faces the same way iOS `LiveType` does:
  Sora for titles / rounded startup copy, IBM Plex Sans for body and
  chrome. Pairing, Operator Setup, and the splash wordmark no longer fall
  through to the system default.
- Live HUD chrome scales with the shortest screen side: 1.0 on iPhone Pro
  Max / 6.8" class (424 dp+), down to 0.935 on compact phones (S25 360 dp).
  Buttons, type, and gaps shrink together; the 16:9 well still fills the
  height. Compact landscape yields 8 dp past the rail so record clears
  the picture without parking the well in the lock lane.
- Android live HUD glass samples the picture: HEVC still decodes into a
  `TextureView`, and FULL glass blits each frame into a Compose Canvas
  inside the Kyant recorded well so the pills frost the feed instead of a
  black plate.
- Android live feed uses OpenZCine's island-lane inset: landscape leading is
  floored at 59 dp so the 16:9 well sits right of lock/battery the way iOS
  does, even when a punch-hole reports no cutout. Compact 16:9 phones
  (S25-class 780×360) then slide the well left only enough that the record
  rail clears the picture. Portrait keeps a 30 dp bottom floor so the system
  rail
  clears the gesture area in sticky-immersive.
- Android live-feed recovery matches iOS: one UDP rebuild, then a SoftAP-kept
  datalink rejoin — not a 5 s rebuild loop — and keepalive will not tear the
  socket during first picture or a GOP-reset gap.
- Android hides the system bars (status, back, home, recents) like OpenZCine:
  a swipe in from the edge reveals them for three seconds and chrome shifts
  off the overlay, then they hide again.
- Tapping Connect on a saved camera shows **Connecting** and **Cancel** on
  Android the way iOS does — GATT starts in `CONNECTING` immediately, and the
  intro card tracks session phase instead of a stale `isBusy` getter.
- Saved-cameras home is titled **Operator Setup** on iOS and Android (the
  header no longer repeats the intro card's "Your cameras."). Android's
  startup glow is Sky Blue at 6% with a 608 pt radius (20% quieter and
  tighter than the prior OLED dim), fading to DJI black rather than a
  full-width cyan wash.
- Android operator chrome now uses the same Kyant liquid-glass pipeline as
  OpenZCine (`glass` / `overlayGlass` / `chipGlass`) with Pocket iOS DJI-black
  and Sky Blue tokens, and only on the same surfaces iOS glasses: live HUD,
  settings row cards / tab rail / close, media category/filter/layout chrome,
  and playback/delivery buttons. Portrait info bar, rec-options menu, media
  list rows, filter/sort pills, and help popovers stay solid fills like iOS.
- Pull-request CI reports one suite instead of duplicating every job from the
  branch push. Gitleaks runs inside Meta checks. **CI gate** remains the only
  required check.
- Public CI: path filter fetches `main` with a slash-safe refspec so
  `docs/**` (and other slash) branch pushes do not fail Detect changes; Android
  installs the official Swift Android SDK without nested unpinned actions; live
  feed orientation tests read spatial edges and Metal rows instead of luma
  after false colour.
- Android CI follows the GitHub Ubuntu Swift toolchain symlink so
  `llvm-objcopy` is found beside the real `swift` binary.
- Public-launch GitHub settings: CI re-enabled with **CI gate** required on
  `main`, force-push off, Actions SHA pinning, and a `scripts/go-public.sh`
  walkthrough for the remaining visibility flip.
- Traffic Lights crush/clip compensation defaults to 0 stops (was ¼).
- Replace the app mark across iOS, Android, and the landing page with the
  production-monitor icon.
- First picture and persisted LUT start together: VideoToolbox opens at the
  first parameter sets instead of waiting and GOP-resetting for a look.
- Handshake returns as soon as the camera ACKs, and open retries cap instead of
  looping forever while SoftAP is up.
- Saved cameras persist the camera Wi-Fi so backgrounding does not drop the
  hotspot config. A live SoftAP drop re-handshakes UDP instead of a long BLE scan.
- Young status with a dead picture requests one live-view enable instead of
  sitting on a black well. Android no longer 1 Hz re-enables live view, and BLE
  or SoftAP loss leaves LIVE.
- Point bug reports, feature ideas, and questions at GitHub Issues and Discussions
  with working category slugs (`ideas`, `q-a`).
- Rewrite public protocol and capture docs so intercept cookbooks stay out of the
  tracked tree.

### Removed

- iOS live gimbal debug plate (TT180 / yaw / Flip / invert forces). Stick
  invert and extra-mirror follow `GimbalStickMapping` only, same as Android.
