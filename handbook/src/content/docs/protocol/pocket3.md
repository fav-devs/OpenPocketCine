title: Pocket 3 reference
description: Physical Mimo observations, confirmed control traffic, and remaining implementation gaps for Osmo Pocket 3.
---

This reference records a physical Osmo Pocket 3 survey on **11 September 2026**,
using **DJI Mimo 2.11.9 (298019) on iOS**. The camera's About screen reported
**V01.06.1004**. These findings describe that camera and app combination;
OpenPocketCine support is documented separately in the
[iOS](https://openpocketcine.app/docs/apps/ios/)
and [Android](https://openpocketcine.app/docs/apps/android/) pages.

The camera firmware corresponds to DJI's **v01.06.10.04** release notation.
Firmware additions can change the menu and protocol behavior, so retain this
version when comparing results. [DJI release history](https://dl.djicdn.com/downloads/DJI_Osmo_Pocket_3/RN/20250826/DJI_Osmo_Pocket_3_Release_Notes_en.pdf).

## How to read the evidence

| Evidence | What it establishes |
| --- | --- |
| **UI** | Mimo displayed an option, selection, dialog or visible effect. A selected setting is not an original-file measurement. |
| **Accepted** | A CRC-valid DUML request matched a successful camera reply. This does not alone prove persistence or the requested physical effect. |
| **Status** | A separate camera report corroborated the resulting state. Reports can lag a menu change. |
| **File** | A preserved file was inspected independently for dimensions, codec, timing or sidecars. Full camera/phone SHA-256 matches are called out separately; receiver remuxes are not SD originals. |
| **Unverified** | A candidate mapping, published specification or untested branch. It is not a replay contract. |

The survey recorded phone IP traffic and Bluetooth controller traffic while Mimo
was operated. The first network segment starts in an existing session. Bluetooth
controller-log timestamps used the phone's local wall clock; the writer source
and measured phone offset support a two-hour normalization, with raw records
preserved separately. This is not a subsecond cross-transport calibration.
This is a bounded observation set, not a claim that every
packet, setting combination or camera-body feature was captured. Private footage,
credentials, identifiers and raw captures are excluded from this page.

## Shooting modes and formats

These are the **observed Mimo choices and selections**. A frame-rate label in
Slow Motion describes the shooting setting; inspect the original before treating
it as the encoded playback rate.

| Mode | Observed format menu | Exercised selections and evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Video, landscape | 1080P, 2.7K, 4K; 24/25/30/48/50/60 | All six rates selected at 2.7K; 1080P/60 and 4K/60 also selected. **UI, accepted**; status corroborates several settled combinations. |
| Video, square | 1080P (1:1), 2160P (1:1), 3K (1:1) | Each selected at 60. **UI, accepted**; square preview visible. 3K/60 recording start/stop accepted and recording status followed. |
| Video, portrait | 3K/25 exercised after body Lock Portrait | Operator/UI context identifies Lock Portrait and D-Log M; a fully validated 1728×3072 HEVC 10-bit original demonstrates native portrait composition. Other combinations and command mappings remain unverified. |
| Low-Light | 1080P and 4K; 24/25/30 | All six combinations selected with **UI and accepted** writes; separate status confirms several settled values. No 2.7K or square choices appear in this menu. |
| Slow Motion, 4K | 4X(100), 4X(120) | Both selected with **UI, accepted and status** evidence. The tested menu includes 100 although the general product specification lists 120. |
| Slow Motion, 2.7K | 4X(120) | Selected in **UI**, with an accepted request; no 100 option visible in this state. |
| Slow Motion, 1080P | 4X(120), 8X(240) | Both selected with **UI, accepted and status** evidence. |
| Photo | Frame 16:9 or 1:1; Countdown Off/3s/5s/7s | Both frames and all timer choices selected in **UI**. The timed square JPEG+RAW shot has a preserved JPEG and independently validated full-resolution DNG. |
| Panorama | 180° and 3×3 grid; Countdown Off/3s/5s/7s | Both capture sequences exercised in **UI**. Stitched JPEGs, 13 JPEG components and the RAW-selected grid's nine DNG components have **File** evidence. |
| Timelapse | 1080P, 2.7K, 4K; 25/30 | All six combinations selected in **UI**. Interval, Duration and Timelapse Mode have separate controls. Short and full Raw+Video takes have matching nine/151 video frames and validated DNG counts. |
| Motionlapse | L to R, R to L, Custom Motion within Timelapse Mode | Settled menus confirm the choices; preview and a custom recording flow exercised in **UI**. |
| Hyperlapse | 1080P, 2.7K, 4K; 25/30 | All six combinations selected in **UI**; Speed offers Auto/2X/5X/10X/15X/30X. |

DJI's published portrait Video sizes are 1080×1920, 1512×2688 and 1728×3072,
each at 24/25/30/48/50/60 fps. The 1728×3072/25 original is measured below;
the other published combinations remain a comparison baseline.
[DJI specifications](https://www.dji.com/osmo-pocket-3/specs).

The existing resolution/fps request is confirmed for Pocket 3 Video and
Low-Light:

```text
0x02/0x18: [resolution:u8] [fps-index:u8] 00 00 00
```

| Resolution label | Resolution byte |
| --- | --- |
| 1080P landscape | `0A` |
| 2.7K landscape | `2D` |
| 4K landscape | `10` |
| 1080P square | `69` |
| 2160P square | `6A` |
| 3K square | `6B` |

Video fps indices `01`–`06` map to 24, 25, 30, 48, 50 and 60 respectively.
Aspect is carried by the resolution byte. Repeated requests sometimes precede
the matched successful reply; an unpaired initial transmission is not itself
a rejection. The [command catalog](../commands/#pocket-3-format-choices-without-a-capability-table)
explains OpenPocketCine's normal-Video fallback when this model does not supply
a usable capability table.

Slow Motion uses the same opcode with a different trailer. The following exact
five-byte requests were accepted:

| Selection | Payload |
| --- | --- |
| 4K, 4X(100) | `10 0A 00 04 00` |
| 4K, 4X(120) | `10 07 00 04 00` |
| 2.7K, 4X(120) | `2D 07 00 04 00` |
| 1080P, 4X(120) | `0A 07 00 04 00` |
| 1080P, 8X(240) | `0A 08 00 08 00` |

Byte 3 follows the displayed 4X/8X multiplier in these samples. Its complete
semantics are not established, but replacing it with the normal-Video zero
trailer would not reproduce these Mimo requests.

Low-Light selection sends shooting mode **`28`** through `0x02/0xE1`, with an
accepted reply and direct status mode 40. The core currently names that value
`superNight`; Pocket 3's Mimo interface presents it as Low-Light video.

### Native portrait recording

In a later physical pass, the operator selected **Lock Portrait** on the body;
the Mimo/operator context identified **3K/25 and D-Log M**. The recorded camera
original is **49,045,559 bytes**, with **1728×3072 HEVC Main 10, 10-bit YUV420,
25fps, 151 video frames / 6.040s**, plus **AAC-LC, 48 kHz stereo** audio lasting
6.016s. All 47 contiguous HTTP 206 ranges validated, the complete SHA-256
matched the transfer manifest, and the primary audio/video streams fully
decoded without error.
The subsequently preserved phone import also has an identical full SHA-256
and length. It is another copy of this recording, not an additional original.

The container's primary video track has an **identity rotation transform** and
1728×3072 dimensions, also present in its video sample description. A decoded
first frame viewed with automatic rotation disabled is upright and fills the
9:16 canvas without visible letterboxing. This establishes native portrait
file composition for this take, separately from the letterboxed webcam outputs.

The D-Log M label comes from the captured UI/operator context; BT.709 metadata
does not measure a log curve. This original was recorded after the earlier
complete card copy and is an additional asset, not part of that inventory.
No new accepted portrait opcode is asserted, and other portrait formats,
color/codec combinations and orientation-lock persistence remain unverified.

## Mode-specific controls

| Control | Video | Low-Light | Slow Motion at 1080P/240 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pro | Advanced settings visible when enabled | Disabling hides the advanced list, leaving Pro and Grid | Advanced settings visible |
| Focus | Single, Continuous, Product Showcase Mode | Single, Continuous; no Product Showcase entry | Single, Continuous; no Product Showcase entry |
| White balance | Auto, Custom; 2000–10000 K endpoints selected | White Balance row visible | White Balance row visible |
| Color | Normal, DLog-M 10bit, HLG | No Color row in the inspected full list | No Color row between White Balance and Channel |
| Color Recovery | Toggle appears with D-Log M; absent in the inspected Normal and HLG states | No row | No row |
| Built-in audio | Mono/Stereo; wind reduction; All/Front/Front and Back | Same rows visible | Same rows visible; visibility does not prove an encoded audio track |
| Monitoring | Grid, Overexposure Alert, Histogram, Timecode Display | Same rows visible | Same rows visible |

At **4K/120 Slow Motion**, the Color row reappeared with Normal, DLog-M 10bit and
HLG. D-Log M and HLG selections were accepted. D-Log M added a Color Recovery
toggle; HLG removed it. The comparison above changed both resolution and rate,
so it does not isolate the cause to 240 alone. Short 1080P/240, 4K/120 D-Log M
and 4K/120 HLG takes had accepted start/stop commands. Their independently
inspected original playback rates, color tags and audio streams are listed in
the media section below.

In Video, enabling Histogram displays a histogram widget over the preview;
disabling it removes that widget. The observed monitor-toggle actions did not
have a camera write classified by the packet analysis. That is not proof that
they can never affect camera traffic. Color Recovery is a Mimo display control;
this survey does not establish its transform or a change to recorded pixels.
Low-Light's Grid menu offered Off, Gridlines and Grid + Diagonals; selecting each
visibly changed or removed the corresponding preview overlay.
The Video monitor's mirror control also visibly reversed the preview and
restored it on the next toggle. The effect on saved media was not tested.

Sharpness, noise reduction and focus breathing compensation were not found in
the inspected Video settings list. Their absence from this list does not prove
that the camera lacks the feature or that no body-side control exists.

### Focus sequencing

Single and Continuous use `0x02/0x24` values `01` and `02`. Accepted replies and
`cam_lens_state` values `B1`/`B2` corroborate those choices. Mimo also manages
AF-C tracking parameter `0x003B` through `0x02/0x8E`:

| Action | Observed sequence |
| --- | --- |
| Choose Single | Clear the tracking parameter with value `01 00`, then set focus `01`. |
| Choose Product Showcase from Single | Set tracking value `01 01`; camera lens state changes to `B2` without a separate Continuous write in that action. |
| Return to Continuous | Clear tracking, then set focus `02`. |

These sequences were accepted. A near/far subject test is still required to
judge focus behavior; other write orders have not been shown to fail.

### White balance and exposure

The existing five-byte white-balance request is confirmed:

```text
0x02/0x2C: [mode:u8] [Kelvin / 100:u16le] [trailing:i16le]
Custom mode = 06; Auto mode = 00
```

Mimo selected 2000 K and 10000 K in Custom, then restored Auto. Requests were
accepted and mode/custom Kelvin were corroborated by `cam_image_effect`.
All trailing request values in this sweep were zero. The signed value at status
bytes 7–8 nevertheless changed, so interpreting those bytes as the operator's
**tint is not confirmed on Pocket 3**. Auto's displayed Kelvin is also distinct
from a requested Custom value. Do not write a changing Auto measurement back as
a manual setting.

Low-Light's manual ISO dial offered and selected 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600,
3200, 6400, **9600**, 12800 and 16000. Auto exposure showed an ISO MAX endpoint
of 16000. These are **UI** results, with additional accepted requests and exposure
status corroborating ISO 9600 (`0x02/0x2A` value **`10`**), ISO 16000 (value
**`11`**) and the **1/8000** shutter endpoint at 4K/30. The ISO encoding is sparse;
do not derive these added values by extending the earlier power-of-two sequence.
In fixed-ISO manual mode, the ISO MAX row disappeared and the EV adjustment
buttons appeared dim. This is not a measured shutter or exposure calibration.

### Glamour Effects

The Video monitor has a separate Glamour Effects panel, with **None** and a
horizontally scrolling list: **Smooth, Brighten, Slim, Eyes, Dark Circles, Nose,
Mouth, Teeth, Lipstick, Blush and Brows**. Selecting None displayed OFF; selecting
an effect displayed ON and exposed its numeric slider.

The corrected slider sweeps established these **UI** values:

| Effects | Observed values |
| --- | --- |
| Smooth, Brighten, Eyes, Dark Circles, Nose | 0 and 99 reached; the upper endpoint was not independently established |
| Slim, Teeth, Lipstick, Blush, Brows | 0 and 100 at the slider endpoints |
| Mouth | −50 and +50 at the endpoints, with 0 at the center |

The Mouth control therefore needs a signed UI range. The other observed sliders
placed zero at the left edge. Their wire values use different scales.

#### Tagged strength values

Parameter `0x0039` of `0x02/0x8E` carries a **62-byte blob**: a little-endian
count of 15, followed by 15 four-byte entries. Each observed entry contains a
little-endian u16 tag, a preserved `01` marker, and a u8 value. The marker may
represent a length; its general semantics are not established. Camera GETs
reorder entries by tag while Mimo SETs use UI order, so compare tagged values
rather than relying on one position for each effect.

The controlled slider writes were **accepted**, with independent camera GETs
corroborating their final values. The following numbers are decimal:

| Control | Tag | Observed UI → wire pairs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Master | 0 | Off → 0; On → 1 |
| Smooth | 1 | 0 → 0; 25 → 20; 99 → 79 |
| Brighten | 2 | 0 → 0; 25 → 25; 99 → 99 |
| Slim | 3 | 0 → 50; 50 → 70; 100 → 90 |
| Eyes | 4 | 0 → 50; 99 → 90 |
| Nose | 5 | 0 → 50; 99 → 90 |
| Mouth | 6 | −50 → 0; 0 → 50; +50 → 100 |
| Teeth | 7 | 0 → 0; 100 → 100 |
| Lipstick | 10 | 0 → 0; 20 → 20; 100 → 100 |
| Blush | 11 | 0 → 0; 100 → 100 |
| Dark Circles | 12 | 0 → 0; 99 → 99 |
| Brows | 14 | 0 → 0; 100 → 100 |

Tags 8, 9 and 13 had no identified UI control and remained zero. Preserve them;
neither a general rounding rule nor a legal range for unknown tags follows from
this sample. Restoring the controls and selecting None returned all 15 tagged
values to their initial camera-reported state.

This live-camera Glamour test scene did not contain a face, so its facial
processing and effect on saved pixels remain unverified. The recorded Glamour-on
take had Smooth at zero. Its immediate ancillary glamour SET returned `DF`,
while recording itself succeeded. The separate
[local editor tests](#mimo-local-editor-and-exports) below do not establish an
equivalent camera effect or command.

### Photo

Mimo's Photo format control is an aspect selector named **Frame**: 16:9 displays
an 8MP label, and 1:1 displays 9MP. Those rounded labels do not establish exact
original dimensions. Countdown offers Off, 3s, 5s and 7s; each was selected.
Photo Format offers **JPEG** and **JPEG+RAW**. A 1:1 JPEG+RAW shot at the 7s
setting displayed a countdown, returned to idle and reduced the remaining-shot
count. Both its JPEG and DNG were subsequently downloaded from the camera.
The preserved JPEG outputs measure **3840×2160** for 16:9 and **3072×3072** for
1:1; full SHA-256 matches establish that the corresponding Mimo imports are
byte-identical to those camera files.

The square shot's **19,314,420-byte DNG** contains a full-resolution **3072×3072
CFA image**, with one sample per pixel, an RGGB 2×2 pattern and uncompressed
**16-bit sample storage**. Its 18,874,368-byte RAW array is separate from the
embedded JPEG previews. Independent TIFF/IFD traversal checked referenced
storage and image segments against the complete file. This establishes actual
RAW content; 16-bit storage does not establish effective sensor precision.
Demosaicing, image quality and dynamic range were not measured.

The Photo Pro list contains Grid, Focus Mode, White Balance, Overexposure Alert,
Histogram, Photo Format and Timecode Display. It has no Color or audio rows in
the observed state. The Focus popup offers **Single and Continuous**. Auto
exposure displayed an ISO MAX endpoint of 6400, and EV adjustment reached
**−3.0 and +3.0**. In manual exposure, all displayed ISO choices were selected
and matched the HUD: **50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400**. Shutter reached
**1/8000s and 1s**, with matching dial/HUD values and no further choices beyond
those endpoints. These are **UI** results, not measured shutter timing or
exposure calibration.

Accepted requests and separate exposure reports corroborate the Photo settings:
ISO 50 uses `0x02/0x2A` value `02`, and ISO 100–6400 use `03`–`09`.
EV uses `0x02/0x2E`; `07` corresponds to −3, `10` to zero and `19` to +3,
with the endpoints echoed at exposure-status byte 6. The 1/8000 and 1s shutter
requests (`0x02/0x28`) were also accepted and echoed. The 1s payload is
`01 01 00 00 00 00 40`, with the reciprocal bit clear. Some intermediate
reciprocal settings carry an additional fractional byte; an integer-only
denominator parser loses that information. Its units need matching UI evidence.

Photo entry used shooting mode **`05`**, with an accepted `0x02/0xE1` request and
direct camera status corroboration. A photo-shutter request `0x02/0x01` with
payload `01` was accepted. The shared `ShootingMode.photo` value `17` belongs to
other model observations; do not use it as the Pocket 3 encoding.

Additional **accepted, UI-correlated** Photo requests were:

| Action | Opcode and observed payload |
| --- | --- |
| Select square frame | `0x02/0x12`, `00 03` |
| Select JPEG+RAW | `0x02/0x16`, `02` |
| Select countdown | `0x02/0x4A`, `00 01 [seconds:u16le]`; 3, 5 and 7 each accepted |

Independent `cam_photo_param` reports corroborate square at byte 1 (`03`),
JPEG+RAW at byte 3 (`02`), and countdown duration at byte 7 (3/5/7). Its byte 11
also descends from 7 to 0 during the timed shot. Only the observed choices are
mapped here. These reports do not prove the photo was written or measure the
timer's physical delay; the preserved files provide the separate write evidence.

### Panorama

Pano's Type menu offers **180°** and a **3×3 grid icon**. Countdown shows the
same Off/3s/5s/7s choices as Photo, though each delay was not exercised in Pano.
Its settings panel is headed Photo and contains the same visible Pro controls.
Its file-format options are **JPEG** and **RAW**, unlike Photo's JPEG+RAW label.

The 180° capture sequence displayed progress then restored the idle monitor.
The grid sequence displayed **5/9** during capture. Preserved downloaded JPEGs
measure **4096×1536** for the 180° take and **4000×3840** for the grid take.
The later card copy contains **four 3072×3072 JPEG components** for this 180°
take and **nine 3072×3072 JPEG components** for this grid take. These are observed
counts for the preserved takes, not a general component-count rule. Stitch
quality remains unmeasured. The three stitched JPEG downloads, including the
later RAW-selected take, have full SHA-256 matches to their camera HTTP files
and copied card files.

A later **RAW-selected 3×3** capture also showed progress **8/9** and returned
to idle. Its album result displayed a rendered still and **Downloaded** status.
The preserved Mimo download is independently identified as **JPEG, 4000×3840**.
The later card copy also preserves **nine 3072×3072 DNG components** associated
with this take. Every full-resolution CFA array was independently validated;
this establishes the RAW source set separately from the stitched JPEG.

The captured mode entry uses `0x02/0xE1` value **`0C`**. Type selection uses
`0x02/0x6E`, with **`05` for 180°** and **`07` for the 3×3 grid**. Pano shutter
uses `0x02/0x01` payload **`07`**, distinct from ordinary Photo's `01`. These
requests were accepted in the corresponding UI sequences; output validation
remains separate. `cam_pano_params` byte 0 independently echoes type `05`/`07`.
Selecting **RAW** uses a separate `0x02/0xE7` request, payload `01 00`.
It was accepted, and `cam_pano_params` byte 1 changed to `01` while the type
remained `07`. Only this RAW value is established; other format values are
not assigned labels here.

### Timelapse

The format popup offers landscape 1080P, 2.7K and 4K, each with 25 or 30 fps;
all six combinations were selected. It shows no square or 24/50/60 choices in
the observed state. A separate dropdown contains **Duration**, **Interval** and
**Timelapse Mode** dials. The following choices were observed across the dial
sweeps; the interval and duration inventory was collected in **Fixed Angle**:

| Control | Observed options |
| --- | --- |
| Interval | 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 60 seconds |
| Duration | Unlimited; 5, 10, 20, 30 minutes; 1, 2, 3, 5 hours |
| Suggested interval labels | Crowds at 0.5/1s; Clouds at 2s; Sunset at 3s |
| Timelapse Mode | Fixed Angle, L to R, R to L, Custom Motion |

At the longest interval the dial displays 1m while the summary displays 60s.
With duration 5h, interval 60s and output 30 fps, Mimo estimates a 10-second
result. This is an estimate in the UI, not a completed five-hour recording.
The recorded five-minute result is documented below.

The **Fixed Angle Timelapse** Pro list contains Grid, Focus Mode, White Balance, Overexposure
Alert, Histogram, Format and Timecode Display. Color and audio rows are absent
from that observed panel. **Format** selects saved media, with choices **Video**,
**JPEG+Video** and **Raw+Video**; it is distinct from the resolution/fps popup.

In the Raw+Video sequence, the selected interval became **2s**. The interval dial
showed 0.5s and 1s in red. Attempting 1s opened a warning that the interval was
too short to save timelapse photos, with **CANCEL** and **Save Video Only**
actions. Cancel retained 2s and Raw+Video. Red values are therefore an entry to
a downgrade decision, not simply untappable options. The equivalent JPEG+Video
warning flow has not been established. A short Raw+Video take entered recording
and later returned to idle. Its preserved output has nine video frames, and the
card copy supplies **nine 3840×2160 DNGs**. Their whole-second EXIF timestamps
span 16 seconds with eight 2-second steps.
A subsequent **five-minute Raw+Video take at 2s, 4K/30** ran through the configured
duration and returned to idle automatically. Camera counters reached elapsed
300 seconds and 151 frames before resetting, with no stop request at completion.
The preserved downloaded video independently contains **151 frames**, lasts
**5.038367 seconds**, and is **3840×2160 HEVC, 8-bit**, at **30000/1001 fps**.
The card copy independently supplies **151 3840×2160 DNGs**, with validated
full-resolution CFA arrays. Their EXIF timestamps span **300 seconds**: 148
successive differences are 2s, one is 3s and one is 1s. These timestamps have
whole-second resolution, so they do not measure subsecond exposure cadence.
The RAW count agrees with both the status counter and video frame count.
Mimo's displayed 30 is not an exact 30/1 in this file.

Timelapse enters mode **`02`** through `0x02/0xE1`. Its start/stop uses
**`0x02/0x01` with `01`/`00`**, rather than the Video record opcode `0x02/0x02`.
These observed requests were accepted. Mimo also sends a **16-byte**
`0x02/0x6C` configuration; controlled menu changes correlate with these fields:

| Byte offset | Observed field |
| --- | --- |
| 0–1 | Constant `04 00` in these samples |
| 2 | Save type: `00` Video, `02` JPEG+Video, `03` Raw+Video |
| 3–4 | Interval as u16 little-endian, in tenths of a second |
| 5 onward | Duration as a little-endian value in seconds; 5min through 5h exercised |
| Remaining bytes | Unresolved; preserve them |

This is a **partial mapping**, not a complete configuration builder. The duration
field's full width is unproven because the tested finite durations fit in 16
bits. Unlimited duration, motion paths, and interactions with other fields need
independent qualification before replay.

Separate 21-byte `cam_lapse_param` reports corroborate save type at byte 0,
interval at bytes 1–2 in tenths of a second, and duration beginning at byte 5.
The save-format comparison reveals a camera-side adjustment: a JPEG+Video request
at 0.5s was accepted and reported save type `02`, interval 5. Switching to
Raw+Video still requested 0.5s, but the accepted write was followed by save type
`03`, interval **20 (2s)**. A second u16 field at bytes 3–4 changed from 5 to 20
as well; its possible minimum-interval meaning remains a candidate. Preserve
these reported values rather than assuming the requested interval took effect.

### Motionlapse

Selecting **L to R** in Timelapse Mode exposed a **Preview** action. The format
changed from 4K/30 to 2.7K/25 while interval 2s and duration 5min remained.
This could be remembered mode state; it is not evidence of a resolution/rate
restriction. **R to L** was visible as a further choice. Preview was exercised,
and a banner indicated that tapping the screen stops it. Subsequent screenshots
had already returned to the dropdown; they do not prove complete preset travel.

Settled menus also confirmed **R to L** and **Custom Motion**. The custom editor
exposes waypoint thumbnails, add/delete controls and a preview action. Waypoints
were added and preview exercised. The resulting layout is consistent with the
fourth-point action, but the saved view does not independently establish four
distinct simultaneous waypoints or their angles. A custom recording showed
active recording with changed framing, then later returned to idle. Exact path,
speed and interruption behavior remain unverified. The preserved short output's
file properties are listed below; they do not establish the full planned path.

In **Custom Motion**, the Pro list showed Format Video and **no Focus Mode row**.
The earlier Fixed Angle Timelapse panel had Focus Mode Single. Keep this
mode-specific visibility separate from the general Timelapse control inventory.

Motionlapse uses shooting mode **`18`**, distinct from Fixed Angle Timelapse's
`02`. Parameter `0x0037` via `0x02/0x8E` has a one-byte value selecting
**Custom `00`, L to R `01`, R to L `02`**. Preview parameter `0x0036` has a
two-byte value, with accepted values `00 00` for Custom and
`01 00` for L to R. A `cam_motionlapse_params` report's byte 3 became `80` during
preview. These are observed sequences, not a complete preview start/stop enum.

The motion status layout has an **8-byte header followed by 12-byte point
records**, with the count at header byte 7. Motion's `0x02/0x6C` configuration
is 16 bytes, starting with `05`; only these point-edit selectors at byte 1 were
observed:

| Point action | Selector |
| --- | --- |
| Save C / delete C | `0D` / `0E` |
| Save D / delete D | `11` / `12` |

The coordinate bytes at offsets 9–14 and the final byte remain opaque. Do not
derive selectors for other points or build a full path writer from these two
pairs. Deletion was followed by changes in surviving point coordinates, so the
experiment does not establish that pre-existing waypoints were restored or that
point edits leave neighboring records unchanged.

### Hyperlapse

Hyperlapse is a separate mode on the rail. Its format popup offers landscape
1080P, 2.7K and 4K, each at 25 or 30 fps; all six pairs were selected. Its Speed
dial offers **Auto, 2X, 5X, 10X, 15X and 30X**. These are UI setting labels;
the preserved outputs' frame rates are listed below, while the actual speed
ratio and Auto speed decisions remain unverified.

The observed Pro controls include Grid, Focus Mode, White Balance, Channel,
Wind Noise Reduction, Directional Audio, Overexposure Alert, Histogram and
Timecode Display. The list ends without a saved-media Format row. Focus offers
Single and Continuous. There is **no Color row** between White Balance and
Channel. Stereo and the microphone settings are visible, but those rows alone
do not establish an audio track in a Hyperlapse original.

Starting **Auto** and **2X Hyperlapse** takes displayed the stop button, recording
timer and microphone meter; later screens confirmed return to idle. During
recording a separate **1X / Auto** or **1X / 2X** choice appeared with the
configured speed selected. The captured frames did not show a successful switch
to 1X. This is a different control from the idle Speed dial; its effect on
captured timing and audio remains unverified.

Hyperlapse mode selection uses `0x02/0xE1` value **`0A`**, with an accepted
reply. Its 16-byte `0x02/0x6C` configuration begins with **`0B`**. Byte 3 took
decimal values 15, 10, 5, 2 and 0 alongside the speed sweep; these are candidate
speed values, not Timelapse interval tenths. Independent status confirmation,
the remaining fields and complete speed encoding still need qualification.

## Audio DSP: preserve the Pocket 3 blob

The Pocket 3 returned a **27-byte audio DSP blob** after the status byte in
`0x02/0xA0` GET replies. Mimo's accepted `0x02/0x9F` SETs preserved all 27 bytes.
This differs from the 26-byte form previously documented for other captures.

| Mimo action/state | Observed blob byte 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Wind reduction off → on, Front and Back selected | `BC` → `BD` |
| Wind on, direction All | `1D` |
| Wind on, direction Front | `3D` |
| Wind on, direction Front and Back | `BD` |

Selecting Front also produced a preceding accepted SET changing blob byte 0
from `C0` to `80`. The observations do not justify replacing the entire blob,
assuming one universal wind mask, or applying another model's
`18`/`1A` and `DA`/`3A`/`BA` table. Read the current blob, preserve its length and
unknown fields, and qualify any mutation by model and state. Acoustic direction,
wind filtering and audio content require separate measurements. Stream/channel
counts for the preserved files are recorded in the media section below.

The current `AudioDspBlob.blob(fromGetReply:)` implementation copies exactly
26 bytes. It would truncate this Pocket 3 response; this reference records the
gap and does not claim the implementation is fixed.

## Zoom and Med-Tele

At 2.7K Video, Mimo's held relative zoom control reached **3.0×**, then returned
to **1.0×**. The camera's lens-status u16 at offset 14 changed **217 → 651 → 217**.
The accepted relative commands were:

```text
0x02/0xB8: 01 [rate:u8] [direction:u8] 00
Observed rate bytes: 48, 49, 4A
Direction: 01 increase; 00 decrease
Stop: FF 00 00 00
```

The second byte appears to control movement rate; its units and full legal range
remain unverified. The absolute `0A 4E [position:u16le]` form was also accepted
when Mimo reset zoom to 1× on entry to Low-Light. This does not establish all
absolute intermediate positions on Pocket 3. An attempted two-finger gesture
selected an ActiveTrack target instead; it is not evidence of pinch zoom.

DJI lists Video zoom ceilings of 2× at 4K, 3× at 2.7K and 4× at 1080p.
[DJI specifications](https://www.dji.com/osmo-pocket-3/specs).

A later **UI** pass reached **2.0× at 4K/60** and **4.0× at 1080P/60**, returning
each to 1.0×. The relative-rate and stop writes were **accepted**, and separate
lens **status** moved **217 → 434 → 217** at 4K and **217 → 868 → 217** at 1080P.
Together with the earlier 2.7K observation, this corroborates the three ceilings
at the tested settings; it does not measure image quality or establish limits
for every mode, aspect and frame rate.

Med-Tele was enabled and disabled in Normal 2.7K Video. Its icon changed state,
the preview cropped, and relative zoom still read 1.0×. The exposure menu showed
an ISO MAX endpoint of 1600. DJI describes this mode as a 2× view with an ISO
ceiling of 1600 and no ActiveTrack; the tracking exclusion was not exercised here.
[DJI release notes](https://dl.djicdn.com/downloads/DJI_Osmo_Pocket_3/RN/20250826/DJI_Osmo_Pocket_3_Release_Notes_en.pdf#page=2).

The two UI actions correlate with accepted seven-byte `0x02/0xFF` requests:

```text
Enable:  00 15 00 0D 00 00 00
Disable: 00 15 00 01 00 00 00
```

This is a **candidate Med-Tele mapping**, not a general `0xFF` schema. The same
opcode also carries a different repeating 34-byte poll. Selector and bitmask
semantics, other mode constraints, and persistence remain unverified.

## Gimbal controls

The Video monitor's gimbal popup contains separate **mode** and **rotational
speed** icons plus Help. Tapping each setting cycles it and displays the new
label in both the popup and a temporary overlay:

| Control | Observed cycle |
| --- | --- |
| Mode | Follow → Tilt Locked → FPV → Follow |
| Rotational speed | Default → Fast → Slow → Default |

The final inspected popup showed **Follow and Default** again. These selections
also produced accepted commands, with independent GETs for tilt lock and speed:

| Setting | Observed control payload | Reported state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speed | `0x04/0x50`: `00 05 01 <value>` | `00` Fast, `01` Default, `02` Slow echoed by GET |
| Tilt lock | `0x04/0x50`: `00 04 01 <value>` | `00` Follow, `01` Tilt Locked echoed by GET |
| Follow/Tilt Locked mode family | `0x04/0x4C`: `02 08`, alongside the applicable tilt-lock setting | Accepted; tilt-lock GET supplies the distinction |
| FPV | `0x04/0x4C`: `01 08` | Accepted; the earlier tilt-lock byte can remain set, so that GET alone cannot identify FPV |

These corroborate the [existing gimbal command model](../commands/); they do not
measure axis response or angular speed.
The separate Gimbal and Handle settings page also exposes Easy Control and
Calibrate; Easy Control was toggled off/on, while calibration was not performed.

The two-page Help view describes Follow as keeping the horizon level while pan
and tilt follow the handle, Tilt Locked as retaining tilt while pan follows, and
FPV as allowing the camera to rotate with the device. It describes three speed
profiles without numerical rates. Those descriptions are **Mimo help content**;
physical handle-motion tests remain necessary to validate the behavior. No
FPV-⊥ option appeared in this three-mode cycle.

The rotate-camera action changed the viewed direction; its return action and
Recenter restored the earlier framing. This establishes a visible response to
the controls, without measuring rotation angle, centering accuracy or repeatability.
Both rotate directions used accepted `0x04/0x4C FE 09` requests; Recenter used
`FE 08`. The reported face-direction bit changed **1 → 0 → 1** across the two
rotations and stayed 1 after Recenter. The initial bit must be retained when
interpreting direction; one request does not always imply the same final facing.

## Color, recording and preserved media

Pocket 3 color requests use `0x02/0x42`: Normal **`00`**, HLG **`3C`**, D-Log M
**`3D`**. HLG and D-Log M selections were accepted and corroborated by separate
image-effect status. Do not substitute Pocket 4 color values.

General → Video Compression offered Efficiency (HEVC) and Compatibility (H.264).
H.264 appeared dimmed in the D-Log M sequence, became selectable in Normal, and
its selection correlated with an accepted two-byte `0x02/0xAB` request. The
Low-Light General panel later showed HEVC. This is a partial availability
comparison, not a complete color/codec matrix or proof of the live-preview codec.

Short takes were started and stopped in HLG, D-Log M, Normal/H.264, Med-Tele and
square 3K/60. The known record request `0x02/0x02` (`01` start, `00` stop) was
accepted, and recording status followed. Mimo additionally sent a 62-byte
glamour parameter SET after record start; those ancillary requests returned
`DF` while recording continued. A rejected glamour write must not be mistaken
for a rejected record command.

The following **20 Mimo downloads preserved from the phone over USB** have
independent **File** evidence. Capture settings identify the experiment; file
metadata supplies the measured output. Each import was size-checked, hashed and
parsed. Subsequently, **20 complete camera HTTP originals matched their phone
imports by SHA-256**, covering every row below, including the later Glamour-on
take. The listed times are container durations unless a video-only duration is
explicitly identified.

| Experiment | Inspected downloaded output |
| --- | --- |
| Video HLG, 4K/25 | HEVC, 3840×2160, 10-bit, 25 fps, 180 frames, 7.200000s; BT.2020/HLG tags |
| Video D-Log M, 4K/25 | HEVC, 3840×2160, 10-bit, 25 fps, 181 frames, 7.240000s; BT.709 tags |
| Video Normal/H.264, 4K/25 | H.264, 3840×2160, 8-bit, 25 fps, 184 frames, 7.360000s |
| Med-Tele, 2.7K/25 | H.264, 2688×1512, 8-bit, 25 fps, 126 frames, 5.040000s |
| Square Video, 3K/60 | HEVC, 3072×3072, 10-bit, 60000/1001 fps, 305 frames, 5.098667s |
| Square Video, 3K/60, Glamour master on and Smooth zero | HEVC Main 10, 3072×3072, 10-bit, 60000/1001 fps, 480 decoded frames; 8.008s video, 8.021333s container |
| Low-Light, 4K/30 | HEVC, 3840×2160, 8-bit, 30000/1001 fps, 174 frames, 5.805800s |
| Full five-minute Raw+Video Timelapse, 4K/30, 2s | HEVC, 3840×2160, 8-bit, 30000/1001 fps, 151 frames, 5.038367s |
| Early-stopped Raw+Video Timelapse | HEVC, 3840×2160, 8-bit, 30000/1001 fps, 9 frames, 0.300300s |
| Custom Motionlapse | HEVC, 2688×1512, 8-bit, 25 fps, 14 frames, 0.560000s |
| 4K/120 HLG Slow Motion | HEVC, 3840×2160, 10-bit, 30000/1001 playback fps, 476 frames, 15.882533s; BT.2020/HLG tags |
| 4K/120 D-Log M Slow Motion | HEVC, 3840×2160, 10-bit, 30000/1001 playback fps, 476 frames, 15.882533s; BT.709 tags |
| 1080P/240 Slow Motion | HEVC, 1920×1080, 10-bit, 30000/1001 playback fps, 1174 frames, 39.172467s |
| Auto Hyperlapse | HEVC, 3840×2160, 10-bit, 30000/1001 fps, 63 frames, 2.133333s |
| 2X Hyperlapse | HEVC, 3840×2160, 10-bit, 30000/1001 fps, 198 frames, 6.613333s |
| Photo, 16:9 | JPEG, 3840×2160 |
| Photo, 1:1 | JPEG, 3072×3072 |
| Panorama, 180° | JPEG, 4096×1536 |
| Panorama, 3×3 grid | JPEG, 4000×3840 |
| Panorama, 3×3 grid with RAW selected | JPEG, 4000×3840; nine full-resolution DNG components subsequently preserved from the card |

The square 3K/60 take is a useful dependency to investigate: the preceding camera
color status was Normal and the last explicit compression SET was H.264, but
the preserved output is HEVC 10-bit. An automatic format-dependent codec change
is a candidate explanation, not a rule established by this sample. The later
Glamour-on take also reported Normal before recording and has the same square
HEVC 10-bit encoding. Its 480 video frames decode successfully, but Smooth was
zero and the scene contained no face: this camera recording does not establish
a nonzero Smooth effect. Processed local-editor exports are documented
separately below.

Audio-stream inspection also distinguishes menu visibility from saved output:

| Preserved takes | Audio streams |
| --- | --- |
| Video HLG and D-Log M | AAC, 48 kHz, mono |
| Normal/H.264 Video, Med-Tele, both square Video takes, Low-Light, Auto and 2X Hyperlapse | AAC, 48 kHz, stereo |
| All three Slow Motion takes, both Raw+Video Timelapse takes, Custom Motionlapse | No audio stream |

The mono/stereo results reflect the selected settings in those takes, not a
color-mode channel restriction. Audio rows and meters remained visible in some
modes whose MP4 outputs contain no audio stream. The card copy supplies separate
**AAC-LC, 48 kHz stereo ADTS files** for all three inspected Slow Motion takes:

| Slow Motion take | Separate AAC duration |
| --- | --- |
| 1080P/240 | 4.906667s |
| 4K/120 D-Log M | 3.989333s |
| 4K/120 HLG | 3.989333s |

All three audio files fully decode. Their durations are consistent with
real-time capture alongside the longer slow-motion playback; sample-accurate
audio/video alignment remains unverified. These AAC companions are separate
from the external-microphone WAV backup feature, which remains untested.

The D-Log M recording-mode identity comes from the accepted color setting and camera state;
**BT.709 tags alone do not identify D-Log M or prove a Rec.709 recording**.
The Slow Motion files also show why the shooting-rate setting must be kept
separate from container playback rate. Metadata alone does not calibrate the
transfer curve or verify audio/video synchronization. Full hashes establish
unchanged downloads for the 20 matched phone files; the later card copy also
matches all 25 previously preserved camera HTTP files. File integrity does not
establish every mode's output behavior. Recording settings and
the live-preview signal are separate; see [live view](../live-view/) and
[HTTP media](../media/).

### Camera HTTP originals and companions

The initial independently verified camera-download set contains **24 complete files**:
the 20 matched originals, the square Photo DNG and three LRF previews. Each saved
transfer has contiguous HTTP `206` ranges, a consistent total length and ETag,
matching local length, and a recomputed SHA-256 matching its transfer manifest.
Incomplete transfers are excluded. This upgrades the earlier partial Low-Light
comparison, whose passive phone capture had missing body ranges; it does not
make those earlier captures complete.

The three inspected LRFs contain H.264 8-bit video at 30000/1001 fps: the Low-Light
preview is **1280×720**, while both square 3K/60 takes' previews are **720×720**.
Preview dimensions, rate and codec therefore must not stand in for the paired
camera original's properties.

On this firmware, requests using the camera's exact slash-separated file path
worked, while percent-encoding the path separators returned `404`. The camera
served byte ranges. Preserve separators when encoding individual path segments;
verify response ranges and total length before treating a download as complete.

### USB card copy and source sets

Selecting **Transfer File/OTG Connection** on the camera mounted its card over
USB. The complete copy contains **361 files totaling 5,073,372,646 bytes**;
all source/copy SHA-256 comparisons matched, with zero copy-validation errors.
The card was then ejected. This inventory includes older takes and auxiliary
card files, including MISC contents. It is not 361 new survey recordings.
All **25 previously verified camera HTTP files, totaling 927,102,530 bytes**,
independently match files in this card copy; the 20 matched phone imports are a
subset. These overlapping collections must not be added together.

The preserved RAW inventory is:

| Capture | DNG count | Full CFA dimensions | Total DNG file bytes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Square Photo | 1 | 3072×3072 | 19,314,420 |
| RAW-selected 3×3 Panorama | 9 | 3072×3072 | 173,940,344 |
| Short Raw+Video Timelapse | 9 | 3840×2160 | 155,263,488 |
| Full five-minute Raw+Video Timelapse | 151 | 3840×2160 | 2,605,540,864 |

All **170 DNGs** contain five TIFF directories (IFDs) and one full-resolution
**RGGB 2×2 CFA array**, stored as one uncompressed 16-bit sample per pixel.
The square arrays each occupy **18,874,368 bytes** and the landscape arrays
**16,588,800 bytes**; the complete files also contain previews and metadata.
Standard referenced data ranges and image bounds pass validation, and all 170
RAW arrays have distinct hashes. Sample statistics on ten representative files
confirm nonconstant image data. This does not establish effective sensor
precision, demosaiced image quality or the meaning of opaque MakerNote fields.

The observed card layout separates rendered outputs from sequence components:

| Observed location | Contents in the inspected takes |
| --- | --- |
| `DCIM/DJI_001` | MP4/JPEG outputs, the same-stem square Photo DNG, and same-stem Slow Motion AAC sidecars |
| `DCIM/PANORAMA/001_<take>` | `PANO_<index>.JPG` for the JPEG takes; `PANO_<index>.DNG` for the RAW-selected take |
| `DCIM/TIMELAPSE/001_<take>` | `TIMELAPSE_<index>.DNG` for both Raw+Video takes |

Here `<take>` and `<index>` replace the observed take numbers and four-digit
source indices. Directory suffixes, capture times and controlled recordings
associate these sets with their outputs. They do not establish a universal
naming algorithm or pixel-by-pixel source-to-video alignment. All 13 source
JPEGs from the two JPEG panorama takes decode cleanly. A later Mac Wi-Fi pass
retrieved two known nested source paths using
`/v2?storage=0&path=<camera-relative-path>`, retaining the directory separators:

| Known component | Complete bytes | Contiguous validated HTTP 206 ranges |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Short Timelapse, `TIMELAPSE_0001.DNG` | 17,250,304 | 17 |
| RAW Panorama, `PANO_0001.DNG` | 19,333,016 | 19 |

Both complete downloaded SHA-256 values match their preserved SD files and
transfer manifests. This verifies retrieval of these exact known nested paths;
automatic source discovery, a universal naming algorithm and every source
layout remain unverified.

### Mimo album

The camera album player displays a **Low-Res** label and exposes Info, Favorite,
Play/Pause, Delete, Download and a scrubber. These are observed controls;
opening a low-resolution preview is not downloading an original. Neither a
Download tap nor an Info dialog alone proves which experiment produced the
selected item. Match the file to the capture sequence before attributing its
codec, dimensions or duration to a shooting-mode test.

The inspected album exposes:

| Surface | Observed controls |
| --- | --- |
| Library source | Device and Local |
| Filters | All, Photos, Videos, Favorites |
| Additional Local filter | Live Photo; a phone-library category, not a Pocket 3 shooting mode |
| Item grid | Media-type badges, clip duration, download icon and completed-download checkmark |
| Selection mode | Selected count/size, Cancel, Batch Select, item checkboxes, Favorites, Download and Delete |
| Batch Download Settings | Add Photo Frame toggle, Download Now, and frame styles Simple, Yearly I, Yearly II, Classic and Flagship |

For the Glamour-enabled clip, Download opened **Select Format to Download**
with **Original File**, **Video with Glamour Effects** and **Cancel**. The sheet
describes the first choice as retaining the original format and the second as
processing videos to add effects. Both displayed an estimate of less than one
minute in this case; that is a UI estimate, not measured processing time.
The original branch produced the preserved file whose full hash matches the
camera original. A later fresh portrait take with camera Glamour enabled
completed the **Video with Glamour Effects** branch: Mimo showed **Adding
effects**, then the completed-download badge. This establishes the effects
download workflow separately from the local editor below. The scene contained
a cat sticker and no human face, so it does not establish facial-effect efficacy
or where processing runs.

Both the fresh camera original and its effects-download derivative fully decode:

| File | Complete bytes | Video encoding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Camera original | 50,164,533 | HEVC Main 10, 10-bit YUV420 |
| Mimo effects-download MOV | 13,871,016 | HEVC Main, 8-bit YUV420 |

Both contain **1728×3072 video at 25fps, 155 frames / 6.200s** and AAC-LC
48 kHz stereo. Audio durations are 6.186667s in the original and 6.200s in the
derivative. The original's 48 contiguous HTTP 206 ranges and complete hash
validated; the preserved derivative's hash also validated. All 155 corresponding
video frames differ when decoded to a common 8-bit YUV420 format, but transcoding
and bit-depth conversion can contribute to those differences. This verifies a
processed derivative with reduced bit depth, not a measured facial effect or
camera color mode. It is not an unchanged camera-original download.

A time-aligned Local Hyperlapse item reported H.265, 3840×2160, 30FPS and 6s in
Mimo Info. Those are **UI** properties of a local Mimo item, not an SD-file
identity check. Returning from Local playback to the live Hyperlapse monitor
was observed.

One settled player changed to **Downloaded** and removed its Download action.
That is UI confirmation of Mimo's reported transfer state; it does not by itself
establish original-file integrity. Album item counts do not establish how many RAW
companions or panorama component files exist. Favorite controls were exercised;
after unfavorite, two settled Favorites views showed no favorite content.
Persistence across a reconnect or app restart remains unverified.

Add Photo Frame was off and its style choices appeared disabled. The panel's
help distinguished standard and live photos; neither a frame export nor each
style was validated. During batch download Mimo displayed transferred-item
count, percentage, transfer rate and a cancel action, with pending, active and
completed states on individual items. An unstable-speed/Wi-Fi-interference
warning appeared during the transfer. That message is an observed app condition,
not an independent diagnosis of radio interference. The first 12-item batch
subsequently lost its progress banner and showed completed-download checkmarks
on all selected items. This is **UI completion**; original metadata and companion
files are separate checks. The metadata and full-file comparisons above validate
the 20 preserved imports. The later card inventory establishes component counts
and RAW/audio companions independently of these album checkmarks. A second
five-item batch also reached this UI completion state.

### Mimo local editor and exports

A separate pass used Mimo's local editor on preserved survey imports. **Six MOV
derivatives totaling 137,719,683 bytes** were exported to the phone and preserved;
all primary video and audio streams fully decode without error. Their sources
match known camera originals by SHA-256. The derivatives are a separate
collection from camera originals and the complete card copy.

The inspected editor exposes these **UI** choices:

| Control | Observed choices |
| --- | --- |
| Aspect | Default, 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 3:4, 9:16, 21:9 |
| Export resolution | 720p, 1080p, 2.7K, 4K |
| Export frame rate | 30, 60 fps |
| Bitrate | Lower, Recommended, Higher |
| Noise Reduction | On/Off; Faster–Better control |
| 10-bit | On/Off |
| Color Recovery → OsmoPocket Series | D-Cinelike, D-LOG M; None also selectable |
| Portrait → Glamour Effects | Off/On; Slim, Chin, Smooth, Brighten, Enlarge, Lighten |

These are editor controls, not additional Pocket 3 shooting formats. In
particular, the family's D-Cinelike preset does not establish Pocket 3
D-Cinelike capture, and a 9:16 aspect choice or the Portrait tool does not
verify native portrait recording. The local six-control Glamour panel is
distinct from the eleven controls in the live-camera panel.

Three controlled export pairs all used **Default aspect, 4K/30 and Recommended
bitrate**:

| Controlled difference | Independently inspected result |
| --- | --- |
| Square project, 10-bit On versus Off; Noise Reduction On/Faster | Both 2160×2160, 30fps, 241 frames / 8.033333s. On produces HEVC Main 10 / 10-bit YUV420; Off produces HEVC Main / 8-bit YUV420. |
| D-Log M source, Color Recovery D-LOG M versus None; Noise Reduction Off, 10-bit On | Both 3840×2160 HEVC Main 10, 30fps, 218 frames / 7.266667s. All 218 corresponding decoded video frames differ. |
| Square source, local Glamour master On versus Off; Noise Reduction Off, 10-bit On | Both 2160×2160 HEVC Main 10, 30fps, 153 frames / 5.100000s. All 153 corresponding decoded video frames differ; first-frame review shows changes in the face region. |

All six contain **AAC-LC, 48 kHz stereo**; within each pair the decoded audio is
identical. The D-Log M source was 4K/25 with mono audio, so its 30fps/stereo
exports also demonstrate that editor output timing and channel count can
differ from the source. No new stereo spatial information or particular frame
interpolation algorithm is established. Likewise, the square project's 4K
export label produced **2160×2160**, not the source's 3072×3072 dimensions.

The local Glamour pair retained the installation's stored strengths: Slim 41,
Chin 46, Smooth 78, Brighten 43, Enlarge 35 and Lighten 57. They are neither
factory defaults nor tested endpoints; no strength slider was changed. Only
the master state changed between exports. Pixel differences do not isolate an
individual control, measure quality, identify a LUT/log curve or establish the
processing location. These local-editor results are separate from the Device
Download → **Video with Glamour Effects** workflow documented above.

## Livestream

Mimo's platform chooser lists **Facebook, YouTube and RTMP**. RTMP was selected
for a receiver on the local network. Entering settings first displayed a
preparation screen estimating about 15 seconds. The settled form exposes
Camera Network Status, an RTMP URL field and the following choices:

| Setting | Observed choices | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resolution | 480p (Smooth), 720p (HD), 1080p (UHD) | Each selection showed its checkmark |
| Frame rate | 25 fps, 30 fps | Both selections showed their checkmarks |
| Streaming quality | Auto, Smooth, HD | Each selection showed its checkmark |

The final setup displayed **1080p, 25 fps and Auto**. These selection checks
establish the setup UI, not the output properties of every combination. The
three-page Help view covers network or hotspot connection, access-point
proximity, and manual Wi-Fi credentials. Manual association and the public
platform/account flows were not exercised.

The local test entered a **Livestream in progress** screen with an elapsed
timer, network indicator and End Livestream button. Ending the session opened
a Cancel/Confirm dialog; confirmation produced Livestream complete, and Done
returned to Mimo's home screen.

### Received output and capture completeness

The receiver evidence independently verifies the tested **1080p/25/Auto** output:
**1920×1080 H.264 High, 8-bit 4:2:0 at 25 fps**, with BT.709 tags and **AAC-LC
48 kHz stereo**.

| Preserved receiver artifact | Verified result |
| --- | --- |
| Bounded Matroska sample | 30.021s container; 729 video frames, starting 0.861s after audio, with uninterrupted 40ms video intervals |
| Full connection recovered as FLV | 74.560s, 1,863 decoded video frames; recovered A/V messages from the publisher TCP stream |

Both pass full audio/video decoding with strict error handling. The FLV was
created offline using the repository's unmodified RTMP parser to copy audio and
video message payloads. Both containers are receiver artifacts, not SD-card
originals.

Receiver-side TCP sequence checks found **no missing byte ranges in either
direction through FIN**, and the capture reported zero drops. Retransmitted
bytes were accounted for during recovery. This establishes the saved TCP
connection's completeness, not every sensor frame or every radio packet, and
does not extend to the phone captures that contained gaps.

The camera-directed BLE setup, receiver-side publisher traffic and absence of
RTMP traffic in the phone's corresponding IP trace support **publishing directly
from the camera to the receiver** in this tested topology. Other topologies
remain untested.

### Pocket 3 configuration and lifecycle

The captured BLE commands used these receiver routes:

| Action | Opcode / receiver | Observed payload and evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enter livestream mode | `0x02/0xE1` / `08` | `1A`; accepted, with camera mode 26 reported separately |
| Join network | `0x07/0x47` / `07` | Credential-bearing payload omitted; reply `00 00` |
| Configure RTMP | `0x08/0x78` / `08` | Version `00` binary/URL form below; reply `00` |
| Start | `0x02/0x8E` / `08` | Parameter `0x001A`, value `01`; reply `00` |
| End | `0x02/0x8E` / `08` | Parameter `0x001A`, value `02`; reply unobserved, but publisher EOF correlates with the confirmed End action |

Pocket 3's configuration has this observed structure:

```text
00 [bodyLength:u16le]
[encoderPreset:9 bytes]
[urlLength:u16le] [RTMP URL:UTF-8 bytes]
```

The body length includes the nine preset bytes, two-byte URL length and URL
bytes. The accepted 1080p/25/Auto request used preset bytes
`0A 70 17 02 01 02 00 00 00`. Their individual meanings are not established by
one output run. This **version 00 direct-URL form differs from the version 01
JSON form observed on Pocket 4 Pro**; matching opcodes do not make the payloads
interchangeable.

The `0x08/0x79` readback differed from the accepted configuration in two preset
positions, so it is not a proven complete settings echo. The earlier UI choices
for 480p/720p, 30 fps and streaming quality did not produce separate configuration
SETs in the analyzed window. Their wire encodings and output properties remain
unverified.

Camera status later returned to Video mode 1, and normal UDP control traffic
resumed after reconnecting. Simultaneous SD recording, interrupted-network
recovery and the full preset schema remain unverified.

## USB modes and interfaces

A Windows 11 host enumerated the body in each USB mode it offers (captures in
`usb-descriptors/`, taken with `tools/usb-descriptor-dump.ps1`; PnP view only,
no raw configuration descriptors yet):

| Body mode | PID | Interfaces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Webcam | `0x0023` | `MI_00` UVC video (`0e/03/00`), `MI_02` UAC audio (`01/00/00`) |
| Transfer File | `0x0020` | `MI_00` RNDIS (`e0/01/03`, Windows binds `usbrndis6`), `MI_02` mass storage (`08/06/50`, two LUNs, `Linux File-Stor Gadget`), `MI_03`–`MI_07` five vendor bulk interfaces (`ff/43/01`, no driver) |
| Charge Only | — | nothing on the bus |
| Mode prompt on screen | — | nothing on the bus |

Transfer File mode therefore carries a USB Ethernet link beside the card, so
the body has an IP address on the cable. Whether the `:7001` poke and the UDP
`9004` [datalink](../duml-transport/) answer on that address, and what the five
vendor bulk interfaces carry, is untested. macOS has no RNDIS driver of its
own; a second configuration with CDC ECM/NCM was not looked for.

## USB webcam

The operator selected **Webcam on the camera body**, then a native AVFoundation
helper on **macOS 26.5.1** received video and a separate microphone sample.
This establishes webcam entry on the surveyed firmware. In this initial pass,
the camera's body color setting was not confirmed; it must not be labeled
Normal, D-Log M or HLG from those results. The later operator-selected D-Log M
pass is recorded separately below. Neither pass demonstrated 10-bit delivery.

### Advertised formats and received buffers

The saved USB descriptors advertise **MJPEG** and **frame-based H.264**, each
with five frame sizes, on a bulk video endpoint:

| Dimensions | MJPEG nominal fps | H.264 nominal fps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1280×720 | 25, 30 | 25, 30 |
| 1920×1080 | 24, 25, 30 | 24, 25, 30 |
| 720×1280 | 25, 30 | 25, 30 |
| 1080×1920 | 24, 25, 30 | 24, 25, 30 |
| 3840×2160 | 24, 25, 30 | 24, 25, 30, 48, 50, 60 |

These labels round discrete frame intervals in 100ns units. For example,
`333333` means approximately 30.00003fps, not 30000/1001. The VideoControl header
reports UVC 1.00 even though the frame-based descriptor form appears in UVC 1.1;
retain that discrepancy when implementing descriptor parsing. H.264 descriptor
fields do not establish its encoded profile or bit depth.
[USB-IF UVC 1.1 specifications](https://www.usb.org/document-library/video-class-v11-document-set).

AVFoundation advertised **`420v`** and **`2vuy`** at the same sizes. These are
uncompressed host formats: 8-bit video-range NV12 and 8-bit packed UYVY,
respectively. They are distinct from the compressed USB transport formats.
[Apple 420v format](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/kvimage420yp8_cbcr8),
[Apple packed 4:2:2 format](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreVideo/kCVPixelFormatType_422YpCbCr8).

All **13 `420v` size/rate combinations** corresponding to the first rate column
delivered buffers with the selected dimensions. The matrix windows were only
about three seconds long; successful delivery is not sustained-performance
qualification. In particular:

| Selected host format | Measured received fps | Largest buffer interval |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3840×2160, nominal 24 | 21.41 | 392ms |
| 3840×2160, nominal 25 | 22.26 | 369ms |
| 3840×2160, nominal 30 | 30.29 | 44ms |

Separate **`2vuy`** requests for **1920×1080/30, 3840×2160/25 and
3840×2160/60** produced **no frames within 20 seconds** each on this Mac,
despite active-format readback. After the failed 4K25 run, stream probe/commit
readback selected descriptor format 2, frame 5, interval `400000`, corroborating
the advertised H.264 path for that attempt. This is a bounded host result,
not proof that H.264 or 4K60 can never work with another host or configuration.

After the final successful **`420v` 4K25** run, both probe and commit read back
**format 1, frame 5, interval `400000`**, selecting **MJPEG, 3840×2160/25**.
These two readback states corroborate the selected descriptor paths for those
attempts; they do not establish a universal host-format mapping or replace
inspection of encoded USB payloads.

The inspected **1080×1920 and 720×1280** outputs contain **letterboxed landscape
images in the tested camera posture**, with black space above and below.
Portrait-shaped buffers do not establish native portrait composition or SD
recording. The separate [native portrait camera file](#native-portrait-recording)
is verified above; webcam composition after physical rotation/orientation lock
remains untested.

Standard camera-terminal **absolute zoom, pan/tilt and roll** returned successful
control-info, current, minimum, maximum, resolution and default reads. Two vendor
extension controls returned 16-byte values and advertised GET/SET support, but
their meanings remain unknown. No camera-terminal or vendor-control writes
were tested, so readbacks do not prove physical control behavior.

### Preserved receiver artifacts and audio

Four video runs—three 4K and one 1080×1920—were preserved as raw host buffers
and lossless FFV1 Matroska files, totaling **361 frames**. Every decoded pixel
matches the retained NV12 pixels after chroma-layout rearrangement. Container
timestamps round the original host timestamps by at most 0.5ms; the original
timestamps are retained separately. The runs include startup/renegotiation
gaps. These are host receiver artifacts, not camera codecs or SD originals.

A separate **5.013333-second USB microphone sample** contains **240,640 stereo
sample frames at 48 kHz**, with nonzero audio and nonidentical channels. The
preserved PCM-float WAV fully decodes to the same host samples. USB audio
descriptors advertise **16-bit PCM, 48 kHz stereo** for both microphone input
and host-to-device audio; AVFoundation's 32-bit float storage does not establish
higher source precision. Host-to-device playback was not tested.
[USB-IF audio format definitions](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/frmts10.pdf).

Video and audio were captured separately, so synchronization and simultaneous
SD recording remain unverified. Raw USB transactions and compressed bulk
payloads were not captured; descriptor/control reads are not an all-packets
recording.

### Follow-up after selecting D-Log M

The operator subsequently confirmed selecting **D-Log M in the body's Webcam
menu**. This is operator-reported setting evidence, separate from the initial
unknown-color pass and from measured image properties. The advertised host
format inventory remained unchanged.

A **3840×2160/25 `420v`** request delivered **75 additional 8-bit NV12 frames**.
All 75 distinct raw-frame hashes match the fully decoded lossless FFV1 artifact
in order. Host timestamps span **3.017700s**, with adjacent intervals from
**19.600 to 74.767ms**; nominal 40ms buffer durations do not establish constant
arrival cadence. This verifies preserved host pixels after the reported color
selection, not a measured log curve, LUT identity or 10-bit USB transmission.
No new encoded USB payload or probe/commit readback was collected in this pass.
Another **4K25 `2vuy`** attempt timed out with **zero frames**; its failure cause
remains unestablished.

After USB exit and a Mimo app relaunch, the camera reconnected to Mimo. An
earlier connection attempt while USB mode was still active had timed out.
This establishes the completed exit/reconnect sequence, without isolating
which recovery step was necessary. Webcam 10-bit delivery, measured D-Log M
encoding, native portrait webcam composition and simultaneous SD recording remain
separate checks.

## General menus and remaining work

Wi-Fi Settings offers **2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz**. Selecting 2.4 GHz opened a warning
that the change disconnects the current network and may require reconnection.
After confirmation Mimo displayed Device Disconnected. Reconnecting restored
the Video monitor, and reopening Wi-Fi Settings still displayed **2.4 GHz**.
This establishes the UI transition and setting retention across that reconnect;
it does not measure the radio channel, spectrum or throughput. Selecting
5.8 GHz again opened the same warning, and subsequent reconnection restored a
changing Video preview with telemetry. Reopening Wi-Fi Settings then confirmed
**5.8 GHz retained**.

The Pocket 3 command sequence has **accepted and independent readback** evidence:

| Action | Opcode / receiver | Observed payload or reply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Select band | `0x07/0x10` / `07` | One-byte payload: `00` for 2.4 GHz, `01` for 5.8 GHz; each replied `00` |
| Read configured band | `0x07/0x44` / `07` | Empty request; reply `00 <band> 01` |

The readback changed **`00 01 01` → `00 00 01` → `00 01 01`**, corroborating the
2.4 GHz selection and 5.8 GHz restoration. The first reply byte is status; the
last `01` remains a preserved field of unknown meaning. This establishes the
configured-band mapping on the tested firmware, not an independent measurement
of the radio channel or persistence across camera power-off.

| Area | Observed coverage | Remaining qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General | Device Management, SD Card Capacity, Format SD Card, Video Compression, Wi-Fi Settings, About | Format warning inspected and cancelled; no format/reset performed. |
| Wi-Fi | 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz SETs accepted; independent readbacks and reconnect UI confirm restoration | Radio-channel verification, throughput and persistence across camera power-off. |
| Gimbal and Handle | Follow/Tilt Locked/FPV and Default/Fast/Slow cycles; Easy Control toggled off/on; Calibrate visible | Axis response, numerical speeds, calibration and physical tracking behavior. |
| Monitoring | Grid choices and several overlay toggles inspected | Signal accuracy, timecode source/sync and per-mode behavior. |
| Media | Initial 20 phone imports and later native portrait import match camera originals; RAW/audio companions and two nested DNG HTTP downloads verified; Device effects-download workflow completed | Automatic source discovery, other source layouts/general HTTP rules, effects-download facial efficacy and interrupted transfers. |
| Local editor | Six validated derivatives: 10-bit, Color Recovery and local Glamour export pairs; aspect/export menus inspected | Other editor tools and output combinations, individual Glamour controls, exact transforms and quality measurements. |
| Livestream | RTMP setup/lifecycle; full local 1080p25 H.264/AAC connection recovered and decoded | Other preset outputs, interruption recovery, simultaneous recording and public-platform flows. |
| USB webcam | Initial 13 delivered 420v combinations/361 preserved frames; operator-selected D-Log M follow-up adds 75 preserved 8-bit frames; separate stereo audio; USB exit and Mimo reconnect completed | Sustained timing, H.264 delivery, measured D-Log M/10-bit output, native webcam portrait, simultaneous SD recording and A/V sync. |
| Connection | Existing-session and warm connection observations | A controlled camera power-off/power-on comparison; app relaunch is not camera cold boot. |
| Accessories/body controls | USB Transfer File/OTG entry, full card copy and ejection completed; webcam entry and bounded host delivery measured | Wireless microphones, external timecode, physical orientation and body-only settings. |

Firmware features still deserving their own evidence include focus breathing
compensation, FPV-⊥, background downloads, webcam D-Log M/10-bit output, recording
cancellation, and built-in audio backup with external microphones. These are
documented features rather than findings from this survey.

## OpenPocketCine portrait format picker

A later operator report found that vertical 3K appeared as only 1080p/4K in
OpenPocketCine's FORMAT picker. The reproduced empty-list fallback discarded
the reported current resolution. Both platforms now retain a reported size
such as **3K 9:16** when the effective format list is empty, and an fps selection
keeps that resolution byte. Reported capabilities and the confirmed Pocket 3
normal-Video matrix still take precedence.

After the corrected app was installed on an iPhone 16 Pro Max on 2026-09-11,
the operator confirmed that the vertical 3K picker worked. Automated tests cover
the empty-list case and preserving portrait on an fps change. Physical Android
and on-camera fps-change checks remain pending. The operator's earlier session
inputs were not captured, so the reproduction does not establish that this
fallback caused that session's behavior. See
[format fallback behavior](commands.md#pocket-3-format-choices-without-a-capability-table).

## OpenPocketCine recording and warm reconnect

A separate physical iPhone check used installed OpenPocketCine **0.1.0 (99)**
on the same camera, already set to D-Log M. Selecting landscape **2.7K/25**
and starting/stopping recording produced accepted writes and independent
status confirmation. App relaunch/reconnect retained 2.7K/25 and D-Log M.
The saved live journal covers 166 seconds after its first-picture flag, with
82 positive frame-rate samples at 25–27fps and no control timeout, video stall,
frozen state or recovery overlay in that window.

The separately downloaded camera original is **42,894,910 bytes**, **HEVC
Main 10**, **2688×1512**, **25fps**, **157 frames / 6.28 seconds**. All 41 HTTP
ranges were validated, the complete SHA-256 matched the transfer manifest, and
all 157 primary-video frames decoded without error. This is an additional
camera file beyond the 24-file Mimo preservation set above. Preview playback
alone would not establish these original-file properties.

The monitor was restored to 4K/25 D-Log M and disconnected with recording
stopped. This qualifies one iOS landscape format/record/reconnect sequence.
It does not qualify the complete picker matrix, Android, or camera power-off
persistence. Both joins were warm; the camera was not power-cycled.

## Implementation follow-up

The operator reported on **11 September 2026** that the OpenPocketCine cold-boot
stall appeared gone and could no longer be reproduced. Its current status is
**not reproducible; cause unconfirmed**. This is an operator retest report,
separate from the captured warm-session checks above.

The earlier saved journal shows controls timing out before picture freezes, then recovery after
a full new handshake. The recovery stages account for the visible delay, but
the initiating fault was not captured on the wire. Successful warm reconnect
and app-relaunch tests do not substitute for a camera cold boot. See the
[startup investigation](https://github.com/erik-sutton95/OpenPocketCine/blob/main/docs/pocket3-startup-investigation.md)
for the evidence, candidate ordering risks and required physical comparison.
No startup fix is claimed by this survey. Resume fault isolation if the stall returns.

The survey has identified concrete gaps to resolve before exposing more Pocket 3
controls in OpenPocketCine:

1. Preserve the full model-specific audio DSP reply and establish safe independent
   wind/directional mutations.
2. Respect the 2.7K 3× zoom ceiling; `CameraModel.activeZoomStops` currently uses
   the generic 4× branch outside Pocket 3's 4K special case.
3. Qualify shooting-mode semantics by model. Pocket 3 Photo uses `05`, while the
   shared `.photo` case is `17`. `ShootingMode.isPhoto` also includes
   `superNight`, but Pocket 3's observed `28` mode is Low-Light video.
4. Qualify WB status tint interpretation and the additional Low-Light ISO values.
5. Keep Med-Tele experimental until controlled replay, status/persistence checks
   and mode restrictions establish a usable command contract.
6. Require original-file validation before promoting mode, codec or color menu
   observations into recording guarantees.
7. Select the model-specific RTMP configuration format: Pocket 3's captured
   version 00 URL payload differs from the current prototype's version 01 JSON.

This inventory guides future implementation. It does not add those controls to
either shell or replace model-specific physical verification.
